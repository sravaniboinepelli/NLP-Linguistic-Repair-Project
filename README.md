# NLP-Linguistic-Repair-Project

Speech to Speech Machine Translation (SSMT) faces several challenges. There exist many key differences between written and spoken language; during SSMT these differences must be handled before the translation can be done, in order to avoid inaccuracies. Since oral communication (speech) is transient, many sentence constructions are not strictly grammatical. These errors in speech are referred to as disfluencies. Dealing with the disfluencies (in speech transcripts) is referred to as the process of linguistic repair.

The objective of this project is to devise a set of rules and create a system to identify instances of repetition disfluencies in speech transcription, as a precursor to the larger task of SSMT.
