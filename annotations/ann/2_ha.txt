so welcome back to the second lecture of the first week so in the last lecture "we were / we was" about the course introduction and this lecture we will start seeing what do we actually do in n l p ok "so" so we ended the last lecture discussing what are the main goals of n l p so we talked about two different course ok so we talked about the very fundamentals scientific goal that is can we have a "very" very deep understanding of the broad language so and the second goal that we discussed was engineering goal that is can be designed implement and test systems that can process natural language and that can be used for practical application for our "day to day" life and we also said that in this course we will mainly focus on the engineering course of n l p so now "so" so we talked about the engineering goals ok now what are these goals so let us see with some examples so now my goals can be "very" very ambitious ok so this is just a fun example so all though so "we" we use google translate every now and then "so" so getting a "very" very good quality a perfect translation is i will say "very" very ambitious goal ok so this is snap short taken from google translate page so if i type google is awesome ah the transition comes out to be google [ FL ] if i go from english to hindi ok so instead of saying something "very" very perfect ah it come it turns out and and says google [ FL ] thats not a good translation for this term ok "so" so why is that because "the" the systems that we have are not perfect "they" they have certain engineering solutions for towards the region but that "be not be" perfect so "you will" you will not get the perfect translation "every" every time and that is what we should always know in back our mind that yes they are not the perfect systems ok similarly this is another example so "if you" if you type in google translate google is cool we will find some in the translation google [ FL ] so now this is slightly better than the last one what is to not perfect ok why i am saying the disease slightly better than the last one "so is" so is shanth one of the translation for the world cool ok yes for a person who is cool you can say that ah cool can have an meaning of shanth ok but thats not the meaning that is intendent "in this" in this sentence google is cool so this is one of the problems that we will also see in this course that a word might have multiple science is how do i know that what is the actual sense that is being use in the sentence so this is in actual engineering problem that has to be solved by designing efficient algorithms ok "so now so" while i was talking about some of the transition that do not go "very" very well valid in google so i am just showing is some examples that yes so this is not not only the case with machines even humans have made blunders when it comes to translation ok so in this slide i am showing you one particular slogan so that was with pepsi so when pepsi went to china for the first time for their campaign so they had the slogan on come alive with the pepsi generation ok and in china they had to translated in to chinese and they ended up translating it as something that meant pepsi brings your relatives back from the dead ok so now this looks very funny ok but if you look at the actual english sentence you see that you can actually come up with a translation like that you see generation is "one to one" with the relatives and alive with "one to one" with back from the dead ok so this is some sort of ah jugglery of this words so that you again come up come up with the "very" very absurd sort of translation so this is not only with the machines even humans have made blunders ok so yeah so this was so previous k f c so pepsi now you can see one with k f c so again when they went to china so they had this slogan on finger licking good and when the translated in to chinese it meant we will eat your fingers off ok "so" so again you can see the licking "and" and all "this" this they have a correspondence with the other translation "so yeah so" unless you know the other guage you will not be able to translate it perfectly with just by using it simple dictionary ok it might give you a "very" very absurd translation so you have out so yes so in their "many" many examples so for example yeah this is called as hand grenade and yeah so work in progress translated as execution progress and "if you can / "if you" if you know" what is the meaning of execution that i am intending here "so yes so" again coming to the ambitious goals ok so if you have hard about the the chatbots that microsoft had ah released the tay tweets ok "so" so it was taken on in less than a day ok so why did that happen so "it" it was responding to "how" how you humans were ah communicating with it and very soon it happen that it was giving "very" very absurd "and" and resist ah tweets and it had to be taken down ok so this is very nice tweet so tay when from humans are super cool to full nazis in less than twenty four hours ok so i am not at all concerned about the future of a i so again that tells you yes so its "very" very difficult to develop a "very" very perfect system "that" that works for open domain conversation ok so is very so its very difficult problem to solve "so now so with so we" have some goals that are ah that are "very" very ambitious but they are very other goals many other goals that are also very practical ok for example finding out if there is a this my queries in correct i am trying to correct it ok so suppose in google you type a query so world cup two thousand fourteen ok and you "missed" missed out on in r so google who give you some sort of ah reply that ok its are you looking for world cup two thousand fourteen so instead of w o l d did you mean w o r l d ok so this kind of automatic query correction which "a" a problem that you can think of solving by using n l p ""very" very so in "very" very systematic manner" ok search engines and query completion again in search engines so if you type somewhat like if you type a start typing a query so they also try to predict what is the complete query ""that your" ah "that' that your" planning so if you type a query google is they will try to complete it with what you have queried before or what other users have queried "with" with these types ok so again so the language modelling concept that we will discuss in this course goes behind all these completion tasks then there is the "very" very important application on information extraction that is you have a lot of uninstructed data "in" "in" in the sense of news report and whatever is so from where you want to identify what are the entities of interest and what are the various relations between these entities ok so for example if you look at this text so from here you can identify that russell is a person who works on the post of president and general manager in the company new york times newspaper ok and "he just he" started his post at this movement so this information is available in the text data but in an un instructed format ok so now can i have an application or a system that are converted in information to a "very" very instructed format so likely here you have seeing it in a set format ok so you are finding out various persons to what company what post they are on and did their tenure start or end so given lot of text data can you automatically build up such instruction data sets of information in relations between entities so this is the task of information extraction and this is a "very" very practical goal of n l p so in this course we will also deal with this problem for certain lectures that how do i start extracting relations between entites from text data what are the different algorithms that go behind it then if you have hard about ah this course so this is a recent news so in one of the course in in professor used a chatbot as a t a for the course ok "so" so what happened in the course so "the student whatever queries the students" were having so they also result in chatbot that can try to analyze the queries and try to give a some readymade answers ok and it was interesting that some training there is the the chatbot was so good that the students failed to notice ok so from the article if you see that ah after sometime when the when the chatbot learnt from the way issues for querying and the responses that where ideal for the queries it was giving answers with some roughly like ninety seven percent certainty and and yeah t a is the actual "the" the human t a is for actual check the responses first in the then they will upload "on" on the photo so this was again "very" very practical goal "so" so you can contrast it with the open domain chatbot that we talked about so this was "very' very domain is specific chatbot so they were they built it only for there own ah course so domain was fixed to their course and the kind of queries you can expect are also limited in number two fixed to a certain domain so building these domain a specific chartbots or conversation agent is it practical "very" very practical goal and also coming up to to be a important application in recent is so thinking you starting from the ah conversation agent that can help you by some product on an e commerce we up side instead of you having to search everything ok can you just provide your specifications to the chatbot and it can search a product for you or "in" in the case of any flight booking system or banking system where you can give a queries and the chatbot can come up with the possible reply by looking in to the document and so on and this is the practical application "that" that can be solved using using n l p then there is a problem of sentiment analysis again lot of work has gone in n l p on this and this is again a "very" very practical code so from "your / all your" tweets all your opinions and comments that you provide in social media can a tool find out what are various sentiments of users and and with that you can also find out are they some transitions and sentiments of the users over the yes ok a lot of research was done with recent presidential elections and in india the the lok sabha elections a lot of research was "on" on finding out what are peoples opinions and sentiments about various political parties and leaders ok many of them actually came across to even predicting who will be the winner "of" of the elections and there are many many other goals so we talked about some interesting goals like building ah say sentiment analysis building domains a specific conversational agents ok doing query completi completion or auto correction of the query but they are many other goals like expand deduction "so" "so" so you will see that if your using gmail or any other the web service many of much of the emails going to the spam folder directly without even bothering you ok "so" so what it happening at the back and so once and email comes in so the system tries to see is it spam or not by doing again text analysis over there and if it just spam it is not even shown to "you" you in your inbox it is join directly send to some a spam folder so spam deduction is again a "very" very practical goal in not only in your emails also on ah so with social media even on on tweets youtube comments even youtube videos finding out what are its spams is again very interesting "and" and challenging problem then you have the problem on machine translation services on the web so think about opening a web page from some other country ok so like from china or ja japan suppose "you have" you have going to visit that country and you want to read "that" that page so you can is google translate to load that page in english or in any other language for you ok and "that" that is "really" really helpful so again this is a very e practical application where n l p "is" is used and find it text summarization so given "a" a big news article or scientific article can i summarize that in short and then there are "many" many other applications where n l p is actually used so remember one of the some of the previous slides that we saw "in this" ah in this lecture so we found out n l p technology is not perfect ok so there are many places where ah systems make blunders so it is not perfect but it is still goodness of a "many" mnay good applications ok so "you can" you can know that by so the way you are using it in your really life so you can a still use that in many "day to "day" day" life applications and thats what is guiding this field that so they are lot of applications and that you can think of so can you come up with ties ideas nice algorithms first soling that problem and actually people would use that and benefit from that ok so lot of applications you can think off where you can helpless society by by doing text processing and analytics so ok "so" so in the in the next so "in this" in this lecture we discussed what are some of the things that we doing in n l p so next lecture onwards we will start talking about see why is n l p heard what makes the language processing a difficult ask to handle ok thank you
