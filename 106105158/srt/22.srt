1
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:25,579
so welcome to the fifth week of this course
so we have so in this week we are going we

2
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:32,079
will be moving up the hierarchy of ah solving
this language processing tasks ok so we had

3
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,250
started with discussing about how do we handle
individual words how do we use how do we make

4
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,130
use of the word or information using language
models and then how do we assign various grammatical

5
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,130
categories a part of speech categories to
the words ok that is why what we are doing

6
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,130
till now

7
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:57,239
now we will go to next level where we will
try to see can we arrange these words in certain

8
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,799
groups ok so this is this is what we study
in this topic of syntax so how are the words

9
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:10,939
being arranged together ok and what can be
how we can automatically find out this arrangement

10
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,079
given a new sentence this will be the topic
of parsing that we will discuss in this week

11
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,909
ok
so what is syntax so in general syntax refers

12
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:29,390
to the way the words are arranged together
ok and also you will see what is the relationship

13
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,950
between various words and the word groups
that is what we will talk about in syntax

14
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,759
so when we were talking about language models
we had discussed what is the importance of

15
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,549
modeling word order so which words occur after
what are the words how we can make use of

16
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,469
that in assigning probability for a sentence
all finding out the next word in completion

17
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:56,049
task or in spelling correction task ok similarly
when we were talking about part of speech

18
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,859
task we saw what are the grammatical categories
part of speech categories so this defines

19
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:09,060
in one sort of equivalence class for words
that is all these words behave like they are

20
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,760
verbs behave in some some equivalent manner
ok similarly all these words are nouns they

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,459
behaving in some equivalent manner similarly
all these are adjectives so you are define

22
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,220
some equivalent classes
now in syntax we will find out some more complex

23
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,959
notions like word is constituency what are
different grammatical relations among the

24
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:39,230
words what what groups or what words are group
together in constituency ok and subcategorization

25
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:47,710
etcetera also included in this in this topic
ok and yeah just to make you understand what

26
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,879
is this notion of syntax so you can relate
to that if you see this particular meme so

27
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,599
i hope you remember this particular character
from a statics this syntax the only part of

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,299
the language it is not but important is it
is right so you can see the way words are

29
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,459
arranged normally in the way we speak and
how they arranged in this particular sentence

30
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,879
ok that was the special characteristics of
this character ok

31
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,739
so now so what are we are going to study in
syntax so let me give you a simple example

32
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:30,810
so i have the sentence the man read this book
ok so by syntax we are trying we are trying

33
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,930
to find out what are the various groups of
word ok that are coming together for example

34
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,420
in part of speech text we found out that the
word the as part of speech of determiner man

35
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,709
as the part of speech of noun read as verb
and so on ok now we are going one level up

36
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:53,799
so now we are saying this is determiner this
is noun this is kind of nominal but they both

37
00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:00,819
together make a phrase noun phrase so i am
saying the man is a noun phrase similarly

38
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,159
this book is also a noun phrase so the there
are two noun phrases here the man and this

39
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:15,079
book but when the verb read or any verb comes
before the noun phrase it makes a verb phrase

40
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,239
ok so all these three words act as a single
unit of a verb phrase ok there is a no such

41
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:29,050
unit for man and read right there is a unit
for read this book and the man and then i

42
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,650
go up saying that a noun phrase and verb phrase
are making the sentence and this gives me

43
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,800
complete hierarchy structure of how the words
arranged in the sentence the sentence is nothing

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,070
but a noun phrase and the verb phrase this
noun phrase contains a determiner and noun

45
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,130
verb phrase contains a verb and noun phrase
which contains and so on so this is the complete

46
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,330
hierarchy of the sentence that i come to know
by this syntax tree and that is the what is

47
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,020
the topic of this week how do we come up with
such syntax tree for a for some sentences

48
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,310
what is the particular formulation that we
will use ok

49
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,320
let me start by defining some basic notions
like what is constituency so in the last example

50
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,700
we saw that a group of words right they act
they acting as some single unit and you can

51
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,790
call them as phrases clauses etcetera so in
part of speech we could have done this substitution

52
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,600
test so i have this sentence the there is
a fill in the blank one in the room ok and

53
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,860
i can i can filling any adjective the green
one the fat one and intelligent one sad one

54
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,280
all that can be filled in so i can fill in
any word that belongs to that particular part

55
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,670
of speech category now here it will be a particular
constituent it will be a particular group

56
00:05:50,670 --> 00:06:00,250
of words that can behave similarly ok like
here so all these four things kermit the frog

57
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,180
they december twenty sixth the reason he running
for president all these are noun phrases ok

58
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,830
and they can occur in a given context so now
for substitution test you can substitute any

59
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,460
of this these four noun phrases and yeah we
will see an example where all these can come

60
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:27,810
in the same in a very very similar context
so how do we name these constituent phrases

61
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,220
so last slide i was showing some noun phrases
so why do we call them noun phrases or something

62
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,580
else so usually the names are given based
on the words that are heading these constituent

63
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,210
what is the head and usually speaking you
can find the head by the word that can substituted

64
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:54,060
for the whole thing ok let me take the first
example the man from amherst ok this is the

65
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,490
this is the phrase they are four words now
which of the four word do you think can substitute

66
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:07,820
the whole thing now that can that can be used
in the grammatical ah function of the of the

67
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,640
complete unit and that will be man where the
man from amherst the word man can be used

68
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:20,520
to denote the grammatical function of the
whole unit so the head here is a noun man

69
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,050
so this will be called a noun phrase ok because
the head man is a noun

70
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,650
similarly extremely clever the head here is
clever this is the adjective so this is called

71
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:39,530
in adjective phrase down the river here head
is down preposition so this will called in

72
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,872
prepositional phrase killed the rabbit the
head is killed the word killed which is a

73
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:50,930
verb so this is called verb phrase so like
that we are we defined what are the constituent

74
00:07:50,930 --> 00:08:01,310
by taking what is the head of that phrase
now in general words can also act as phrases

75
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,140
so a phrase need not have always multiple
heads a single word can also be a phrase so

76
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:16,420
let us take the simple example joe grew potatoes
so joe itself it is a noun phrase ok potato

77
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,830
also a noun phrase they are nouns but also
a noun phrases in this case now compare the

78
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:32,339
sentence with the man from amherst grew beautiful
russet potatoes so what do you seeing so instead

79
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,330
of joe i have substituted the man from amhrest
a complete a four word unit that is again

80
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:43,310
a noun phrase and beautiful russet potatoes
instead of potatoes they are still noun phrases

81
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,779
ok so what happen in the sentence joe appears
in a place where you could a probably put

82
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,910
a larger noun phrase now this gives a very
nice idea about the structure of the sentence

83
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,390
ok in this sentence i am having a noun phrase
and a verb phrase verb phrase contains a verb

84
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,340
and noun phrase and noun phrase you can you
can either put a single word like joe or you

85
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,520
can put multiple words like the man from amhrest
similarly in that noun phrase you can put

86
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,550
potatoes or it become noun phrase like beautiful
russet potatoes so this gives me lots of idea

87
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,530
about how words are grouped in arrange together
now there is some evidence that questions

88
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:33,260
actually exist in language yes they are two
different evidences one is that this phrase

89
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,240
is appear in very very similar environment
so far i have talk about the four phrases

90
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,040
that noun phrases that discussed in one of
the various phrases like let we see this examples

91
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:51,520
kermit the frog comes on stage note it they
come to massachusetts every summer december

92
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,860
twenty sixth comes after christmas the reason
he is running for president comes out only

93
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:05,550
now so all these four nouns phrases are coming
in a very similar context of the word say

94
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:11,080
comes yes but i cannot take any individual
word from here and put that in the context

95
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:20,430
so i cannot take the word the and say the
comes our out or i cannot say is comes out

96
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,960
and i cannot say for comes out in this sentence
ok i can only say the reason he is running

97
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,460
for president comes out only now ok not an
individual word so this whole thing behaves

98
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,830
as a single unit and they occur in similar
context all the noun phrase occurring in similar

99
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:43,940
context this is got evidence to constituency
what is the other evidence so the evidence

100
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:51,000
is that this whole phrase is together can
locate many locations in the same center ok

101
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,120
so for example if i take on december twenty
six that is the prepositional phrase and i

102
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,779
can put it in many different phrases in the
sentence on december twenty six i would like

103
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:07,920
to fly to florida i would like to fly on december
twenty six to florida or i would like to fly

104
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,460
to florida on december twenty six all three
are valid sentences where this complete phrase

105
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:21,480
on december twenty six has we put in multiple
location but you cannot break this into two

106
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,740
parts and put it in phrases ok so you cannot
say on december i would like to fly twenty

107
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,900
sixth to florida or on i would like to fly
december twenty sixth to florida you cannot

108
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:39,000
say that so this will as a single group it
cannot be split of part ok so these are some

109
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,500
evidence that constituency actually exists
in the language

110
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:52,190
now what is the formal tool by which we can
model this constituency that is how words

111
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:58,830
are arranged together which words come together
which was do not come together ok and what

112
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,831
groups make a sentence and what groups make
a verb phrase what group make a noun phrase

113
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:10,070
how can i model all that what is the formulation
ok and if you have take any course on formal

114
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,700
language in automated theory all theory computation
you might already know that the formulate

115
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,710
that we can use that in context free grammar
ok this is the most common way of modeling

116
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:29,860
constituency so in one of the earlier lectures
we talked about the ah languages by using

117
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,520
deterministic finite automata of finite automata
ok so this is context for context free languages

118
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,330
by using by the context free grammar
now so i will not going in very very basics

119
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,990
i will just talk briefly how do we use context
free grammar i will also defined the notions

120
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:56,490
for the context free grammar so in the case
of context free grammar what you will have

121
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,520
you will have some sort of production rules
that is what we mostly interested in so what

122
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,490
they do the production rules will try to express
what are the way in which various symbols

123
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,310
of the language of group together ok and that
is our main interest in using context free

124
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:18,210
grammar which symbols are being group together
that i can use that i can find out using or

125
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,980
i can express using the production rules in
context free grammars

126
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,160
so let us see one simple example so i want
to model this language that is noun phrase

127
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,670
can be composed to either a proper noun or
a determiner followed by a nominal where a

128
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,830
nominal can be more than one nouns that is
something i want to express about language

129
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:51,710
so how do i use the context free grammar so
i will say noun phrases proper noun or determiner

130
00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:03,750
nominal ok the nominal is noun or many nouns
so how i write in context free grammar i will

131
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:24,631
say noun phrase is proper noun or determiner
nominal and what is a nominal it is one noun

132
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:31,660
or more than one noun so noun or noun by a
nominal ok this is the regression here so

133
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:40,130
i can allow as many numbers of nouns as i
want by using this ok and that is my ah context

134
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:46,170
free grammar for for denoting the symbol ok
that is the idea i can express all these facts

135
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,730
about language how words are groups together
which groups come together by using this production

136
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,980
rules
so once we know that what is the ah formulation

137
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,750
of context free grammar very briefly said
so in context free grammar when we study when

138
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:08,600
we talk about a quadruple ok so therefore
four four important variable set of variables

139
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:15,290
so firstly i have set of terminals we have
the leaf notes in my tree whenever we see

140
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,580
so they will always come at the end and whenever
i get a terminal i cannot derive anything

141
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,710
from there so i have set of terminals so we
will see what in the case of language what

142
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:33,200
do they mean then we have set of non terminals
that help me to do the derivations ok these

143
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,980
are the variable from which you can further
derive in more

144
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:45,430
now so what is different in the case of n
l p what is some distinguish will make in

145
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:52,050
the set of non terminals we will also distinguish
the set p that are pre terminals ok so pre

146
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,170
terminals are those non terminals that will
always derive terminals so they will always

147
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,640
give me leaf nodes ok and with the example
that will be clear what are what are they

148
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,470
in the case of language
then i have start symbol from which i am starting

149
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,020
my derivation ok so if i have to model the
sentence i should be starting with s that

150
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:20,330
is the sentence and then i have the rules
and they always of form x going to gamma ok

151
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,779
and x has to be a non terminal a single non
terminal and gamma can be any sequence of

152
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,350
terminals and non terminals and that is the
constraint that we see in case of context

153
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,410
free grammar ok so this is the quadruple and
we also seeing a pre terminal that is that

154
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:43,430
is the set of non terminals in the language
what are terminals and pre terminals terminals

155
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,320
in the language will mainly with the final
words that i will see in the lexicon and pre

156
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,520
terminals will be part of speech categories
from the pre because from the pre terminals

157
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,050
you can derive only terminals ok
so let us see one example and then we can

158
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,250
point out what are terminals pre terminals
and non terminals so this is what we are modeling

159
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,409
earlier ok what is the noun phrase determiner
for the nominal or a proper noun and where

160
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:17,220
a nominal is a noun or a set of nouns which
i model using a noun followed by a nominal

161
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,689
now are you see some terminals here so there
are no words so there is no terminals so i

162
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:30,059
cannot use that to derive a phrase or a sentence
it can only give me a set of grammatical categories

163
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:36,179
so i have to include some facts on the lexicon
to make it a complete grammar ok

164
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:44,039
so so for example i can includes some determiners
some nouns and some proper nouns so here i

165
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:52,529
am including a and the has to determiners
and flight as a noun now here can you identify

166
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,351
what are the terminal non terminals and pre
terminals so terminals are the words in my

167
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:03,690
lexicon so a the and flight are my terminals
pre terminals are the grammatical categories

168
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,980
or parse category that will always give me
terminals can you see that determiner noun

169
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,630
are only giving me terminals so these are
my pre terminals and apart from that all the

170
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:26,720
variables like n p nominal they are my non
terminals so proper noun no example is given

171
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,341
but proper noun is also a pre terminal ok
it is part of speech category it will give

172
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:39,220
you some words to the lexicon so these are
my terminals non terminals and pre terminals

173
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:51,470
so now once you have the c f g you can use
that to generate various phrases or sentences

174
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:59,720
in language so for example i here this is
the c f g for non phrases so can i can i generate

175
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,649
a flight the phrase a flight is in this context
free grammar ok so i will have to start with

176
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:11,110
n p and i have to generate a flight so what
is the first derivation i will to do from

177
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:18,470
n p i will take this rule determiner followed
by a nominal yes now determiner will give

178
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,450
me a now from nominal i cannot go to flight
directly so for nominal i will have to first

179
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:31,480
get a noun and from noun i will get a i get
the word flight so n p gives me determine

180
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:40,029
nominal nominal gives me noun determiner gives
me a a a noun and a flight thats how it generate

181
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:46,649
a sequence of words using this grammar and
now you can do it for any sentence you can

182
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:53,610
define a grammar for a sentence and generate
a sentences from that ok

183
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,899
so what we are seeing here so there is a context
free grammar is generate a series of strings

184
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:06,779
ok and this sequence of rule expansions so
the sequence that ah that you are using starting

185
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,470
from n p going to determiner nominal then
determiner noun then a noun then a flight

186
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:19,919
this is called the derivation of the string
using this grammar and we use it is tree structure

187
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,340
to represent this derivation ok remember one
of the very first tree that we had shown as

188
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,030
a motivation so we will try to come up with
such trees using this derivations and when

189
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:36,139
we will be call the past tense ok
now what is the notion of grammaticality using

190
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:42,549
context free grammars the idea is that you
defined one grammar for your language ok you

191
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:46,739
have to assume that this is the this is the
only grammar so any tool that is not expressed

192
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:54,460
in the in the grammar is not allowed in the
language so now when you are given a new sentence

193
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,649
if you can see that there is a way to generate
this sentence using my grammar the sentence

194
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:05,259
is grammatical as per my grammar if the sentence
cannot be generated in the grammar this is

195
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:10,330
not grammatical this is a simple notion or
using this grammar whatever sentence i can

196
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,230
generate is grammatical and whatever i cannot
is not grammatical so it depends on the grammar

197
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:23,220
that you have designed the context free grammar
that you have designed so yes so whatever

198
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,779
can be derived are grammatical and others
are ungrammatical

199
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:34,139
now c f gs are interesting because they can
also model some very interesting phenomena

200
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:41,450
in in language syntax like recursion ok so
in language you make lot of big big sentences

201
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:49,149
by ah doing recursion so for example a preposition
phrase can be written as a preposition followed

202
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:55,759
by a noun phrase ok and noun phrase can be
written as a noun phrase followed by a preposition

203
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:04,909
phrase so you see there is a recursion here
yes so i can encode the noun phrase noun and

204
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,139
prepositional phrase is here preposition phase
can again encode a noun phrase which can encode

205
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:13,769
a proportion phrase so this is the recursion
is very very common in language ok

206
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:22,330
so let's see one example so the set example
is the mailman ate his and this is the complete

207
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:30,210
noun phrase is starting from lunch till the
end of the sentence lunch and noun phrase

208
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:37,039
is a noun preposition phrase with and this
is not shown here but this is again starts

209
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,129
a noun phrase preposition phrase is a preposition
followed by a noun phrase with his friend

210
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:49,009
from the cleaning staff and all this is a
noun phrase and what is this noun phrase noun

211
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:55,340
ok his friend followed by a preposition phrase
and so on the recursion is very nicely captured

212
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:06,779
by using context free grammar ok
now shall end this lecture by just saying

213
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:13,350
what is the context denotes in context free
grammar what is the meaning of context so

214
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,330
language we talk about context as such ok
so we say context is given a word find out

215
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:25,200
what is the context what are the previous
words and what is the ah topic and all that

216
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,739
so these are all define the context but this
context is nothing to do with what is context

217
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:34,019
in the case of context free grammar this is
very very formal notion ok

218
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:42,379
so ah so this is nothing do with the ordinary
meaning of word context in language so all

219
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:48,700
this means is that in context free grammar
whenever i am doing a derivation ok so whenever

220
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:57,320
i am writing a gives the b c ok or say noun
phrase give me determiner nominal whenever

221
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:04,470
i am writing a rule like that it means is
that the noun terminal left it all in its

222
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:11,879
own by itself ok it does not need any context
around it so i can always write a goes to

223
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:22,919
b c irrespective of whatever is around my
word a ok so even if i have x a earlier i

224
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:31,840
can use a to derive x b c and if i have irrespective
of what is x or any y i can always write like

225
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,899
this and this x and y are immaterial they
do not matter it can be null it can be whatever

226
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:45,669
similarly if i inferring whenever i see a
b c i can always infer a so this it might

227
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:53,629
have come from a independent of the context
of b c and this is what context free grammar

228
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:59,390
so if you go would go the next label of context
sensitive grammars there are you need the

229
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,450
context this word a can derive b c in this
particular left context in a particular right

230
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,509
context we do not need this left and right
context in the case of context free grammars

231
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,740
ok this what the context the word context
means in this case

232
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:24,070
so so whenever i have a rule a goes b c it
means that i can write a i can always write

233
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:30,989
from a b followed by c regardless of the context
in which a is found or whenever i find and

234
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:39,789
b followed by a c i can infer a regardless
of the context in which b and c is found so

235
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:47,379
so this is c f g for for us ah i am not going
to lot of basics of context free grammars

236
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,690
and i suggest that you can quickly look at
any of the chapters in the basic books of

237
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:58,830
ah formal languages and automated theory so
but whatever is required for our ah tasks

238
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,869
of doing parsing i have covered in this lecture
i will and i will cover the necessary things

239
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:09,960
in the next lecture so in the next lecture
what we will do we will start from c f gs

240
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,230
and we will see how we can use that for actually
doing the parsing for a given sentence in

241
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,669
the in the language ok so we will take a various
approaches for parsing ok so that will be

242
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,129
the next topic for the next lecture
thank you
