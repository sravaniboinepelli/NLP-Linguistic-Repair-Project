1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,340
so welcome back to the second lecture of the
first week so in the last lecture we were

2
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,230
we was about the course introduction and this
lecture we will start seeing what do we actually

3
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,250
do in n l p ok so so we ended the last lecture
discussing what are the main goals of n l

4
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,720
p so we talked about two different course
ok so we talked about the very fundamentals

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,260
scientific goal that is can we have a very
very deep understanding of the broad language

6
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:57,610
so and the second goal that we discussed was
engineering goal that is can be designed implement

7
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,800
and test systems that can process natural
language and that can be used for practical

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,750
application for our day to day life and we
also said that in this course we will mainly

9
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,920
focus on the engineering course of n l p
so now so so we talked about the engineering

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,120
goals ok now what are these goals so let us
see with some examples so now my goals can

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,869
be very very ambitious ok so this is just
a fun example so all though so we we use google

12
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:34,670
translate every now and then so so getting
a very very good quality a perfect translation

13
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,799
is i will say very very ambitious goal ok
so this is snap short taken from google translate

14
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,840
page so if i type google is awesome ah the
transition comes out to be google [FL] if

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,219
i go from english to hindi ok so instead of
saying something very very perfect ah it come

16
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,710
it turns out and and says google [FL] thats
not a good translation for this term ok

17
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:05,540
so so why is that because the the systems
that we have are not perfect they they have

18
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,979
certain engineering solutions for towards
the region but that be not be perfect so you

19
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,130
will you will not get the perfect translation
every every time and that is what we should

20
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:24,550
always know in back our mind that yes they
are not the perfect systems ok similarly this

21
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,481
is another example so if you if you type in
google translate google is cool we will find

22
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:35,800
some in the translation google [FL] so now
this is slightly better than the last one

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,150
what is to not perfect ok why i am saying
the disease slightly better than the last

24
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,520
one so is so is shanth one of the translation
for the world cool ok yes for a person who

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,840
is cool you can say that ah cool can have
an meaning of shanth ok but thats not the

26
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,629
meaning that is intendent in this in this
sentence google is cool

27
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,290
so this is one of the problems that we will
also see in this course that a word might

28
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,890
have multiple science is how do i know that
what is the actual sense that is being use

29
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,909
in the sentence so this is in actual engineering
problem that has to be solved by designing

30
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:21,650
efficient algorithms ok so now so while i
was talking about some of the transition that

31
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,819
do not go very very well valid in google so
i am just showing is some examples that yes

32
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,980
so this is not not only the case with machines
even humans have made blunders when it comes

33
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,110
to translation ok so in this slide i am showing
you one particular slogan so that was with

34
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,909
pepsi so when pepsi went to china for the
first time for their campaign

35
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:49,769
so they had the slogan on come alive with
the pepsi generation ok and in china they

36
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,849
had to translated in to chinese and they ended
up translating it as something that meant

37
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:04,120
pepsi brings your relatives back from the
dead ok so now this looks very funny ok but

38
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,170
if you look at the actual english sentence
you see that you can actually come up with

39
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,000
a translation like that you see generation
is one to one with the relatives and alive

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,870
with one to one with back from the dead ok
so this is some sort of ah jugglery of this

41
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,380
words so that you again come up come up with
the very very absurd sort of translation so

42
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,510
this is not only with the machines even humans
have made blunders ok so yeah so this was

43
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,110
so previous k f c so pepsi now you can see
one with k f c so again when they went to

44
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,259
china so they had this slogan on finger licking
good and when the translated in to chinese

45
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,260
it meant we will eat your fingers off ok
so so again you can see the licking and and

46
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,300
all this this they have a correspondence with
the other translation so yeah so unless you

47
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,820
know the other language you will not be able
to translate it perfectly with just by using

48
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:06,360
it simple dictionary ok it might give you
a very very absurd translation so you have

49
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,110
out so yes so in their many many examples
so for example yeah this is called as hand

50
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:19,710
grenade and yeah so work in progress translated
as execution progress and if you can if you

51
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:28,250
if you know what is the meaning of execution
that i am intending here so yes so again coming

52
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,030
to the ambitious goals ok so if you have hard
about the the chatbots that microsoft had

53
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:41,560
ah released the tay tweets ok so so it was
taken on in less than a day ok

54
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,630
so why did that happen so it it was responding
to how how you humans were ah communicating

55
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:56,139
with it and very soon it happen that it was
giving very very absurd and and resist ah

56
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,560
tweets and it had to be taken down ok so this
is very nice tweet so tay when from humans

57
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,789
are super cool to full nazis in less than
twenty four hours ok so i am not at all concerned

58
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:14,440
about the future of a i so again that tells
you yes so its very very difficult to develop

59
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,220
a very very perfect system that that works
for open domain conversation ok so is very

60
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:32,490
so its very difficult problem to solve so
now so with so we have some goals that are

61
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,050
ah that are very very ambitious but they are
very other goals many other goals that are

62
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:44,960
also very practical ok for example finding
out if there is a this my queries in correct

63
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,860
i am trying to correct it ok so suppose in
google you type a query so world cup two thousand

64
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,900
fourteen ok and you missed missed out on in
r

65
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,410
so google who give you some sort of ah reply
that ok its are you looking for world cup

66
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:07,509
two thousand fourteen so instead of w o l
d did you mean w o r l d ok so this kind of

67
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:14,379
automatic query correction which a a problem
that you can think of solving by using n l

68
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:21,830
p very very so in very very systematic manner
ok search engines and query completion again

69
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,910
in search engines so if you type somewhat
like if you type a start typing a query so

70
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,819
they also try to predict what is the complete
query that your ah that that your planning

71
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,280
so if you type a query google is they will
try to complete it with what you have queried

72
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,289
before or what other users have queried with
with these types ok

73
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:46,530
so again so the language modelling concept
that we will discuss in this course goes behind

74
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:54,979
all these completion tasks then there is the
very very important application on information

75
00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:01,699
extraction that is you have a lot of uninstructed
data in in in the sense of news report and

76
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:08,220
whatever is so from where you want to identify
what are the entities of interest and what

77
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,360
are the various relations between these entities
ok so for example if you look at this text

78
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:21,050
so from here you can identify that russell
is a person who works on the post of president

79
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,300
and general manager in the company new york
times newspaper ok and he just he started

80
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,229
his post at this movement so this information
is available in the text data but in an un

81
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:37,860
instructed format ok
so now can i have an application or a system

82
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,470
that are converted in information to a very
very instructed format so likely here you

83
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,880
have seeing it in a set format ok so you are
finding out various persons to what company

84
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:56,000
what post they are on and did their tenure
start or end so given lot of text data can

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,190
you automatically build up such instruction
data sets of information in relations between

86
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,590
entities so this is the task of information
extraction and this is a very very practical

87
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:12,000
goal of n l p so in this course we will also
deal with this problem for certain lectures

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,940
that how do i start extracting relations between
entites from text data what are the different

89
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:26,860
algorithms that go behind it
then if you have hard about ah this course

90
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:35,400
so this is a recent news so in one of the
course in in professor used a chatbot as a

91
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,540
t a for the course ok so so what happened
in the course so the student whatever queries

92
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,960
the students were having so they also result
in chatbot that can try to analyze the queries

93
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,060
and try to give a some readymade answers ok
and it was interesting that after some training

94
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,540
there is the the chatbot was so good that
the students failed to notice ok so from the

95
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,300
article if you see that ah after sometime
when the when the chatbot learnt from the

96
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,760
way issues for querying and the responses
that where ideal for the queries it was giving

97
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,440
answers with some roughly like ninety seven
percent certainty and and yeah t a is the

98
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,420
actual the the human t a is for actual check
the responses first in the then they will

99
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,860
upload on on the photo
so this was again very very practical goal

100
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,120
so so you can contrast it with the open domain
chatbot that we talked about so this was very

101
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,090
very domain is specific chatbot so they were
they built it only for there own ah course

102
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,420
so domain was fixed to their course and the
kind of queries you can expect are also limited

103
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,160
in number two fixed to a certain domain so
building these domain a specific chartbots

104
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,830
or conversation agent is it practical very
very practical goal and also coming up to

105
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:56,341
to be a important application in recent is
so thinking you starting from the ah conversation

106
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,440
agent that can help you by some product on
an e commerce we up side instead of you having

107
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,480
to search everything ok can you just provide
your specifications to the chatbot and it

108
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,240
can search a product for you or in in the
case of any flight booking system or banking

109
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,000
system where you can give a queries and the
chatbot can come up with the possible reply

110
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,140
by looking in to the document and so on
and this is the practical application that

111
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:32,030
that can be solved using using n l p then
there is a problem of sentiment analysis again

112
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,800
lot of work has gone in n l p on this and
this is again a very very practical code so

113
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,110
from your all your tweets all your opinions
and comments that you provide in social media

114
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:50,170
can a tool find out what are various sentiments
of users and and with that you can also find

115
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,770
out are they some transitions and sentiments
of the users over the yes ok a lot of research

116
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:01,520
was done with recent presidential elections
and in india the the lok sabha elections a

117
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,910
lot of research was on on finding out what
are peoples opinions and sentiments about

118
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,880
various political parties and leaders ok many
of them actually came across to even predicting

119
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:19,990
who will be the winner of of the elections
and there are many many other goals so we

120
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:27,460
talked about some interesting goals like building
ah say sentiment analysis building domains

121
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,710
a specific conversational agents ok doing
query completi completion or auto correction

122
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:39,180
of the query but they are many other goals
like expand deduction so so so you will see

123
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,820
that if your using gmail or any other the
web service many of much of the emails going

124
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,550
to the spam folder directly without even bothering
you ok so so what it happening at the back

125
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,240
and so once and email comes in so the system
tries to see is it spam or not by doing again

126
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,260
text analysis over there and if it just spam
it is not even shown to you you in your inbox

127
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,550
it is join directly send to some a spam folder
so spam deduction is again a very very practical

128
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:14,740
goal in not only in your emails also on ah
so with social media even on on tweets youtube

129
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,040
comments even youtube videos finding out what
are its spams is again very interesting and

130
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,320
and challenging problem
then you have the problem on machine translation

131
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,180
services on the web so think about opening
a web page from some other country ok so like

132
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,460
from china or ja japan suppose you have you
have going to visit that country and you want

133
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,520
to read that that page so you can is google
translate to load that page in english or

134
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,760
in any other language for you ok and that
that is really really helpful so again this

135
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,410
is a very e practical application where n
l p is is used and find it text summarization

136
00:13:53,410 --> 00:14:00,920
so given a a big news article or scientific
article can i summarize that in short and

137
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:09,880
then there are many many other applications
where n l p is actually used so remember one

138
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,160
of the some of the previous slides that we
saw in this ah in this lecture so we found

139
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,210
out n l p technology is not perfect ok
so there are many places where ah the systems

140
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:29,310
make blunders so it is not perfect but it
is still goodness of a many mnay good applications

141
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:35,730
ok so you can you can know that by so the
way you are using it in your really life so

142
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:41,520
you can a still use that in many day to day
day life applications and thats what is guiding

143
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,690
this field that so they are lot of applications
and that you can think of so can you come

144
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:55,060
up with ties ideas nice algorithms first soling
that problem and actually people would use

145
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,610
that and benefit from that ok so lot of applications
you can think off where you can helpless society

146
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:08,200
by by doing text processing and analytics
so ok so so in the in the next so in this

147
