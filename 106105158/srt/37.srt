1
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,920
so hello every one welcome to the week eight
of this course in the last week we had started

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,470
a discussions on semantics and we discussed
a particular method for caption semantics

3
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,610
that ware distribution semantics so how we
can use the distribution patterns of words

4
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,690
in a corpus to extract meanings out of that
and we said that how we can compare two words

5
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,680
to find out if they are more similar than
an an another pair of words

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,980
so so in this week what we will be doing we
will be taking another approach of semantics

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,980
that is by using the connections that we see
among items in an lexicon and that's where

8
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,880
we will also see how to use a very ah important
resource that is word net for extracting meaning

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,780
some ah between words so so topic for this
week is lexical semantics

10
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:14,140
so how can we define lexical semantics so
as a as i am saying what we are doing in this

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,290
topic we will see some entries in a lexicon
and we will try to identify what is the relation

12
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,929
between these generatives so we will have
some particular set of relations and we will

13
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:30,220
try to defined these relation among these
entities so so in that way we can define this

14
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,899
this field so lexical semantics is concerned
with the systematic meaning related connections

15
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,900
among lexical items so i will have a certain
lexical items in my lexicon and i will try

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,910
to find out what are the connections between
any two items and we will be also see what

17
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,880
are the internal meaning related is structure
of individual lexical items

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,890
so what you are seeing here we are not focusing
our attention to something called a lexical

19
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,899
item so what what is the lexical items so
so lexical item i there is another term for

20
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,119
that this called lexeme so this is this is
nothing but an individual entry in my lexicon

21
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,040
so here i am talking about connections among
different lexical items and what is the single

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:23,020
entity it will call a lexeme and we will mostly
we talking about in terms of lexemes now so

23
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,090
if we try to understand intuitively what would
be there in an entry in in an lexeme entry

24
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,860
what what are the things that i need to keep
in an entry so because i am also talking about

25
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,790
the meaning if a word as multiple meanings
it should not be called like a single lexeme

26
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,659
it should be called as two different lexemes
so when i talk about lexeme what all things

27
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:48,849
i need to have i need to have what is the
form so how do i spell that how do i pronounce

28
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:54,630
that and also some something that says what
is the meaning of this particular entry so

29
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,209
these are the two important components that
make like a lexeme so i will have so i can

30
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,040
think of lexeme as a pairing of some orthographic
and phonological form that is how do you write

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,170
the lexeme how do you pronounce that and with
some sort of symbolic meaning representation

32
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,540
ok something that might be definition of the
lexeme or something that explains what this

33
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,450
it's stands for
so when i talk about orthographic form and

34
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:28,680
phonological form they are the the form part
of the lexeme and then i have a science part

35
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,750
of the lexeme that talks about the meaning
of the lexeme so if we have seen in various

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,079
dictionaries that's all the entries are also
defined so let me take one example so this

37
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:45,060
is example from the dictionary that comes
with mac so you are having a a suggest single

38
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,129
word like verge but it appear size three different
lexemes so we are having verge one verge two

39
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:58,829
and verge three ok and do you do i see the
pair the form part in the meaning part so

40
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,790
form part is giving on top for each entry
so i have the spelling so that is the same

41
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:10,680
for all three then i have the pronunciation
also ok then there is there are certain descriptions

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,319
about this entry that that correspond to what
is the meaning of this entry

43
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,269
for example you might have the lexical creditory
of that so it's a noun it's a noun it's a

44
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,890
verb and then there is some meaning like an
edge or border they they come they come down

45
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,210
to the verge of the lake so also given an
example how it is used and some history of

46
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:36,210
the words also provide it so when i talk about
lexeme that's what i need i need a form part

47
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,060
that can be the spelling of the lexeme plus
the pronunciation and the meaning part once

48
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:47,780
i have done that now we can try to establish
relations between various lexemes in my lexicon

49
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:55,210
or each lexical items in my lexicon
so now what are the various meaning related

50
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,800
facts you can extract from the with the lexemes
and defined in my dictionary so let's take

51
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,440
some examples from this heritage american
heritage dictionary so is nineteen eighty

52
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,039
five version and what we are seeing here we
are seeing four different entities here right

53
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,259
left red and blood they are four different
lexemes in my in this dictionary and some

54
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:26,990
meaning of these entities are also provided
so so for example right is defined as located

55
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,199
near the right hand especially being on the
right when facing the same direction as the

56
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,470
observer and left is defined as located near
to this side of the body then the right so

57
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,169
this is some definitions provided to these
lexemes

58
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:45,170
now what is something that you can immediately
ah some point that you can immediately see

59
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:52,710
from the these definitions so one thing that
you see is that the word right has been defined

60
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:59,160
terms of right this is some sort of circular
definitions if you say if you say in that

61
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,990
way and also lexemes are defined in in terms
of other lexemes ok so like here red the color

62
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,120
of blood or a ruby and blood is defined the
red liquid ok so blood is defined in terms

63
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,490
of red and red is defined in terms of blood
so we see that there is some sort of circularity

64
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,039
involved here in the in the way we have defined
in the lexicon

65
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:29,500
but even even if that is the case you can
still extract some sort of meanings for example

66
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,129
if you see the definitions of right and left
you can easily find out that they are somewhat

67
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,690
related they mean their meanings are very
much related and you might also say that they

68
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:45,360
might be in some sort of ultra[vation]- with
respect to each other ok

69
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,039
so so what do we see here so the entries are
description of lexemes in terms of other lexemes

70
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,750
and from the definitions i can see that right
and left are some similar sort of lexemes

71
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:05,169
and they are in some sort of alternation or
opposition also from these definitions we

72
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:12,840
can see that red is some sort of color and
and it can be apply to blood as well as ruby

73
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,460
and blood is some liquid so you might extract
some other facts about the lexemes also from

74
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,919
these from these entries
now in general so when i am talking about

75
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,229
identifying what is the connections of different
between different entries what are the various

76
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,389
formal connections that have been defined
and what are the relations that we can study

77
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:43,300
so let us have a look at some of the relations
so so these are some very important relations

78
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:52,599
that are established between word meanings
and forms so like homonymys polysemy synonymy

79
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,419
antonymy hypernymy hyponymy and meronymy and
you might have heard of some of the list terms

80
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,400
like polysemy which very very popular and
similarly synonymy and and antonymy so these

81
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,050
we might already have heard so let us try
to formally define what are these relations

82
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,750
and and when do i say that to and it is my
lexicon are connected by a particulation from

83
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:20,080
one of these
so how do i define homonymy so homonymy is

84
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,740
defined as a relation that holds between words
that have the same form but unrelated meanings

85
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,620
so what is that mean so we have defined an
individual entre entries in my lexicon as

86
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:39,190
having if form part and a meaning part so
now if two entities have the same form part

87
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,860
but the meaning part is different then they
will called the homonymys ok you think of

88
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:52,390
an example of ah two such or a single word
that as the that as ah same form but two different

89
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:59,360
meanings so simple example might be like the
word bank bank and before the financial institution

90
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,200
bank or it can be some river bank similarly
bat it can be for the cricket bat or it can

91
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,460
be the bat as a mammal so what you are seeing
here they are having the same form but different

92
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,060
meanings
so these are two examples that that we talked

93
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:23,130
about now so there is one important thing
that you should remember here so we are seeing

94
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,560
that they have the same form but different
meanings but we have defined form to be both

95
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,750
orthography form and phonological form so
it might happen that it in certain cases the

96
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,220
orthography form is same and meaning is different
and in some cases the phonological form is

97
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,070
same and meaning is different they are called
homonymys but there are specific terms for

98
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:50,520
both of these and these are called homographs
if there is the same orthography and homophones

99
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,780
if there is the same phonological form let
us see some example so homophones are the

100
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,600
words that have the same pronunciation but
different spellings ok and different meanings

101
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,490
also so example here are write and right there
is the same homological form they are written

102
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,940
differently and their meanings are different
same with piece and peace and homographs would

103
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,130
be the lexemes and that the same orthographic
form then they would have may be the different

104
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,210
pronunciation and different ah meaning all
to gather so for example the two different

105
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:34,029
usage of bass one in the sense of in the sense
of a guitar or music

106
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:40,480
now now why do we need to worry about this
ah homonymys so we will see what are the different

107
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,380
n l p application where they create a problem
so ah let's take this example of text to speech

108
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,970
so do you think these homon homophones or
homographs would create a problem for ah text

109
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,420
to speech so what do we do in text to speech
in text to speech you would have a text contain

110
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,170
written it can be a sentence where there are
multiple words together and you need to speck

111
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:10,940
that out so why the homophones or homographs
can create a problem for that now think of

112
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,450
the same ah same word that as the that as
the particular spelling but it is pronounce

113
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,520
into different ways into different meanings
so unless you know what is the particular

114
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,960
sense it's being implied you cannot pronounce
it properly ok

115
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,460
so if the of orthographic form is same but
the phonological forms are different that

116
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:38,960
creates a problem for text to speech now it
can also create the problem for information

117
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,560
retrieval so so why the problem for information
retrieval so suppose you are looking for the

118
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,160
term bat ok and by bat you implied the the
mammal but sup the suppose the systems gives

119
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,810
you ah cricket bat as as the ah desired or
as the ah page edge that that you will look

120
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,050
for and immediately it will not match your
information need

121
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,310
so what would happen if the same word as multiple
meanings if you are searching for that word

122
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:15,440
because your only a specifying the the orthographic
form it is not it may not be clear to the

123
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,830
search engine what is the meaning that you
are looking for so this also create a problem

124
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:26,510
for the search engines
and it might be problem for the speech in

125
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:35,800
also for example the perfect ah homonymys
ho homophones where you have the same phonological

126
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,920
form but different way of writing that so
suppose you are writing to ah suppose you

127
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,430
are speaking to so it may not be clear which
of the three words should be ah the correct

128
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,230
interpretation whether it is to or to or two
t w o t w o ok so these are also problematic

129
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:01,680
for i speech reorganization so these are some
problems where they they create problem ah

130
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,240
now so suppose the the systems have to deal
with that so how do they find out when i am

131
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,761
talking about to is it t o or is it t w o
t t double o and for that they have to use

132
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:23,730
various information from the context in which
that is spoken or something about the speaking

133
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:30,930
and so on and some of the problems of this
kind we will also deal in this week in the

134
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,570
topic of word sense disambiguation that if
a word as multiple meanings how do i use the

135
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:43,510
context to identify what is the particular
meaning is beings used here

136
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:49,910
so now coming to the second relation that
is polysemy so polysemy and homonymy might

137
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,600
be confused with a certain times so polysemy
is also the same sort of relation that is

138
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,770
a word as multiple meanings but the same form
but the difference here is these meanings

139
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:08,070
are very related and not unrelated tight we
had in the case of homonymys so in case of

140
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:15,180
homonymys two words have same form but very
different meanings for polysemy they have

141
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,940
the same form and slightly related meanings
ok not not very very similar and not very

142
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:28,760
very different also
so what is the example let us see ah let us

143
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,920
focus on the word bank here in the two sentences
in the first sentence we see the bank was

144
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,220
constructed in eighteen seventy five out of
local red brick and second one is the the

145
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:47,070
sentence i withdrew the money from the bank
so as such if you if you look at this sentences

146
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:53,080
you may feel that so there the same word bank
is being used in the for the same sense but

147
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,420
if you look closely you find there is some
slightly def some slight difference between

148
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:06,710
the meanings of the word bank so what is the
difference here in the first sentence the

149
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:12,910
bank is used as some sort of building that
belongs to a financial institution ok on the

150
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,720
other end second sentence it belongs to the
financial institution itself and that sort

151
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:27,040
of ah slight gradation in meaning is is there
in many many such words for example let us

152
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,300
look at these two sentences heavy snow caused
the roof of the school to collapse and the

153
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,750
school hired more teachers this year than
ever before so again the same word school

154
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:45,420
is being used an as they look the same sense
but again if you look closely this refers

155
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,420
to the building of a school and this refer
to the institution a school as such or their

156
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:59,260
administration
so and and these relations are called systematic

157
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,330
ok so for example if you look at these words
school university hospital church supermarket

158
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:11,650
all of these can be seen as the building as
such or the institution and that's why the

159
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:17,540
two meanings would be ah slightly related
they are not very very different and not exactly

160
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,810
the same there are some other examples like
you can have the men the ah connection between

161
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:30,360
the author and the works of author so if i
say jane austen wrote emma some talking about

162
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,800
the author on the other hand i if i say i
really love jane austen so what do your meaning

163
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,440
is that i really love the works of the author
so author in works of author again appearing

164
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,510
some sort of slightly different meaning side
that is that is ah observed by ah this term

165
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,220
polysemy
similarly animal versus meat so when you chicken

166
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,750
it can be animal or meat similarly sometimes
it can be tree versus fruit and this kind

167
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,339
of relation like if i say plums so if i in
this sentence plums have beautiful blossoms

168
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:11,000
plums mainly refer to the tree but here i
ate a preserved plum would be a fruit so again

169
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,130
there are very very slight distinction between
the meanings here

170
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:26,199
now ah ah in in linguistics so suppose i want
to distinguish ah identify if the if the same

171
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,990
word is being is into different sentences
it is been used in slightly different ah meanings

172
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,450
ok all is it is the word polysemys somehow
so what is one particular linguistic test

173
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,980
that we can do and this test is called zeugma
test and what is the idea suppose the same

174
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:52,409
word has been used in two different sentences
now try to compose a single sentence where

175
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:57,419
the word has been used only once and the two
different ah usages have been captured by

176
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:03,720
some sort of consumption and see if this sentence
is making sense already is looking weird if

177
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,730
the sentence is making sense ok so probably
this word as the same sense in both the sentences

178
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,639
but if the sentences looks weird then you
ok there are polysemys

179
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:19,059
so here is an example so i have the same words
serve being used in two different sentences

180
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:26,429
so which of these flights serve breakfast
and does midwest express serve philadelphia

181
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:32,610
now i want to find out if there is some polysemy
involved in the usage of the word self here

182
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,710
so what i would do i would combine these to
ah usages together in a single sentence so

183
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,690
what can be one sentence we can compose out
of this so you can compose like does midwest

184
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,570
express serve breakfast in philadilphia ok
and immediately we are serving breakfast in

185
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,929
philadelphia putting them together in the
same sentence looks weird ok you can put them

186
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:59,799
in to a different sentences ok but putting
them in same sentence looks weird then we

187
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:06,759
can say that so these two usage of the words
are are polysemys so here does midwest mist

188
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:14,340
west express serve breakfast and san jose
if you put them together it ah sounds weird

189
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,110
so we say that they are two different senses
of the word serve

190
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:24,789
so so that's what we have covered homonymy
polysemy remember they are very very ah it

191
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,539
may not be easy to distribution among the
two in polysemy they are quite related in

192
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:37,250
homonymy they are very very different in general
if you might also you might in in general

193
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:45,879
you might say that word is you note that the
word has multiples senses now the next relation

194
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:53,360
that we will see is synonymy what is synonymy
two words that have very very similar meanings

195
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,380
but different orthographic and phonological
form so examples are like couch and sofa they

196
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:09,149
have same meaning different words big and
large automobile car water h two o ok so now

197
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:16,159
what is a important here is these two words
are similar meanings but probably they are

198
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,860
not substitutable in all the contexts ok for
example in scientific context you might want

199
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,659
to write h two o but not water but when you
are all talking in general terms you would

200
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,000
use the term water crossing you to give give
you water you will not ask give you h two

201
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,379
o ok so so all though the meanings might be
very very singular depending on the context

202
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:47,549
you use one word or the other
so as such we can call two lexemes are synonyms

203
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:52,399
if they can be successfully substituted for
each other in all situations but this not

204
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:56,320
actually the case we cannot in general you
cannot substituted them in all the places

205
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,640
you can probably do them most to the places
but not so now let's take an example so i

206
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:11,740
take two words big and large and let's see
these sentences how big is that plane i can

207
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,990
also write how large is that plane so would
i be flying on a large or small plane so with

208
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:24,340
word plane i can use the word either big or
large and both are substitutable here so in

209
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,980
that sense they look like perfect synonymys
but can i always replace big for large of

210
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:37,610
large for big in all the contexts let's see
this example suppose i have the sentence miss

211
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:44,571
nelson for instance became a kind of big sister
to benjamin ok and suppose i replace big by

212
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:49,450
large here and the sentence comes out to be
miss nelson for instance became a kind of

213
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,769
large sister to benjamin and immediately you
can see that this this usage of word large

214
00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:00,919
immediately it starts looking weird ok and
why is that the case so that means we cannot

215
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:07,509
substitute large for big big here ok and and
why is is that

216
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:13,509
so because you would you would see that big
has a very very specific sense that is being

217
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:20,720
grown up or elder and that sense never applies
to the word large ok so big has a sense of

218
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,309
being older or grown up but large as such
lacks this sense it does not have this sense

219
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:34,179
sometimes they are very shades of meaning
in an some sort some words of being preferred

220
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:40,360
to use them other words like when you are
talking about what is the cheapest first class

221
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:48,350
fare we will talk about you will prefer to
say fare then price ok sometimes there are

222
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:54,580
collocational constraints so with some particular
words only one word goes not the other one

223
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:01,929
even if they have very very similar meanings
for example before mistake would you ah like

224
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,310
big mistake or large mistake generally big
mistake is preferred so here this is the sentence

225
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:12,990
so we frustrate e m and frustate e m and pretty
soon they make a big mistake ok and we would

226
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,539
not substitute large here so large mistake
is not collocational but big mistake is collocational

227
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:26,249
ok so because of language usage also some
words are preferred to be used then others

228
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:32,620
so they cannot be substituted at all places
probably in some places

229
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:41,690
now coming to the next relation that is antonyms
so here i say that so what is the general

230
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:49,220
ah notational the general ah definition of
antonyms two words if they are entirely opposite

231
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,149
to each other they are opposite to each other
but this is something interesting about antonyms

232
00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:04,179
so two words antonyms if they are completely
ah so we we said that they are they are having

233
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:10,499
very very opposite meanings but in general
if you look closely they will have very very

234
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:16,529
related meanings but they are opposites only
in word particular aspects so let's take one

235
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:23,390
example see like hot and cold ok so so do
you call them are they related or are they

236
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,580
very very diff very different so as such they
are related they both talk about temperature

237
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:35,690
yes but they are at the ah opposite ends of
the history extreme so we will say ok it's

238
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,299
cold one extreme and hot is the other extreme
but as such both talk about temperature

239
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:46,289
and ah suppose you you try to use the distribution
semantic method that we tried in the last

240
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:51,470
week to capture if two words are antonyms
it might become very very difficult because

241
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:59,440
we would occur in very very similar contexts
yes so hot and cold occur with words like

242
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:07,990
weather yes temperature and so on so so what
we are saying in antonyms they are having

243
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:15,909
very very ah similar meaning but they are
opposite only in one aspect of the meaning

244
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:23,941
so like dark and light short and long ok hot
and cold up and down in and out they are opposite

245
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:32,649
only in one aspect otherwise they are similar
so more formally we can say that and antonyms

246
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:37,840
can define some sort of binary opposition
or at opposite ends of a scale so like long

247
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:47,090
and short hot and cold fast and slow and be
reversives it's like rise and fall now coming

248
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,169
to another important relation that is hyponymys
and hypernymys now what are hyponymys and

249
00:25:52,169 --> 00:26:00,490
hypernymys so they are relations between a
subclass and a super class ok so so formally

250
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:07,399
we say one sense is a hyponym of another if
the [fir/first] first senses more specific

251
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:15,879
and a denotes a subclass of the other so example
here is like car car is a subclass of vehicle

252
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:21,259
so we can say that car is a hyponym of vehicle
similarly dog is a class of animal so we say

253
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:26,169
dog is a hyponymy of animal and mango is a
hyponymy of fruit because mango is a type

254
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:31,450
of fruit
now just the other other way round the relation

255
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,509
would be called hyponymy so i say mango is
a type of fruit so fruit is a so so fruit

256
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:45,429
is a super class so mango is a hyponymy of
fruit and fruit is a hyponymy of mango ok

257
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:50,389
so conversely we can define the hypernymy
relation also so vehicle is a hypernym of

258
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:56,119
car and animal is a hypernymy of dog and fruit
is a hypernymy of mango and these are of some

259
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,850
of the relations that we will ah see very
very closely what is so how do we use hypernymy

260
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:09,320
relation for extracting various meaning related
facts among entities

261
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:17,519
so with hyponymys we can also defined some
formal ah criteria so for example entailment

262
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:24,940
if i say that sense is a hyponymy of sense
b that means being an a entails being a and

263
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:33,860
b for example as a dog is a hyponymy of animal
dog is subclass animal is super class so being

264
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:41,440
a dog entails being an animal as it's some
some entities dog it is an animal so it will

265
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,899
have all the characteristics of animal also
impose on that and but you cannot say the

266
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:52,139
other way round that is some ah if someone
something is a dog animal it is also called

267
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:59,019
dog this is not valid so if a is a hyponymy
of b i will say being an ah a entails being

268
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:05,700
an b you can also define the transitivity
relation that is if a is hyponymy of b b is

269
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,460
a hyponymy of c then a is also hyponymy of
c that is also very very trivial condition

270
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:20,320
on hyponymys so entailment in transitivity
now we can also define other relations like

271
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,059
meronymys and holonyms so meronymy is some
sort of asymmetric but transitive relation

272
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:34,190
between senses what is that so i will say
x is a meronym of y if x denotes a part of

273
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:43,919
y so it's not symmetric so example is so here
porch is a part of house or wheel is a part

274
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:51,779
of car so to define the part of relation i
say wheel is a meronym of car leg is a meronym

275
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:58,909
of chair nose is a meronym of face and the
other where round relation is called holonym

276
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:07,759
that is face is a holonym of nose car is a
holonym of wheel and so on

277
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:13,919
so now so so we saw what is the different
relations that we can defined among lexical

278
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:21,119
entities so now ah what are what are the different
lexical sources where these relations are

279
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,690
nicely captured so where you can you can find
out what entries are related by the relation

280
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:33,769
of hyponymy hypernymy and meronymy and use
for different ah tasks or application that

281
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:38,929
you want to bit and that's what we will see
in the next lecture then we will ah have a

282
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:44,580
discussions on what is the structure of word
net and how are all these relations defined

283
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:50,259
in word net and how can you can use that to
capture various semantics like ah whether

284
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:55,233
these two words are related or not and to
word degree that will be the ah topic for

285
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:57,019
the next lecture
thank you
