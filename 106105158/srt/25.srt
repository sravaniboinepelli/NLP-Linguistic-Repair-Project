1
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,060
so hello everyone welcome back to the fourth
lecture of this week in last lecture we had

2
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,700
discussed what is pcfgs and we we finally
came up with what are the interesting problems

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,390
that that we would like to answer so for example
what is the most likely parse for a given

4
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,250
sentence as per my pcfg grammar and what is
the probability of the sentence as per the

5
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,000
grammar finally we also wanted to see how
do i learn my pcfg rule probabilities ok if

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,450
you remember this was the only difference
between context free grammar and the probabilities

7
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,310
version is that all the production rules here
have a probability value

8
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,121
so how do i learn these values so this is
what we will be covering in this lecture and

9
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:05,610
in the next lecture and we will be using a
specific concept called called inside outside

10
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,920
probabilities ok and this will be very analogous
to what you studied in forward backward algorithm

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,210
in in terms of learning parameters for h m
m so we will go to that

12
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,080
so we so starting with the first problem how
do i find out the most likely parse for a

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,150
sentence and this can be solved simply if
we use the c k y algorithm for pcfg ok so

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,610
from the example that we did in the last class
i hope you you understand now how to use c

15
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,610
k y algorithm for the context free grammar
so today i will show how do you extend that

16
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,180
for p c f g
so let us take an example so we have this

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:53,560
pcfg so what you are seeing here with each
rule you have a rule probability as well ok

18
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,640
and and you can verify that all the probabilities
starting from a given right hand side will

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:09,200
add up to one so now i want to find out what
is the most likely parse for the sentence

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,370
the same sentence the pilot likes flying planes
so for that i need to find out what is the

21
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:26,040
probability with which i can find a non terminal
as in the final position for deriving this

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,230
whole sentence zero to five so we proceed
nearly in the same manner as we did ah in

23
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:39,760
the in the case of c k y ok so what i will
do i just take the same example how we solve

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,860
c k y in addition and what are the things
that you need to do different here

25
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:53,810
so this is what we had seen last time so if
you have to build a if you have to find out

26
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,220
what is the whether the sentence can derive
this whole thing i fill it starting from zero

27
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,890
one one two two three three four four five
then i will go further so now i just tell

28
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:17,020
what is what will differ in the case of pcfg
so now with each non terminal there will be

29
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,700
probability with which it can derive that
particular terminal or a set of terminals

30
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,760
so it is starting from the first element so
this says that the non terminal dt derives

31
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,709
a now i will write down here what is the probability
ok so if you go to your grammar the probability

32
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,910
dt gives me a it's point three so i will put
point three here

33
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:48,200
similarly for this element what is the probability
that n n gives me pilot and if i look at my

34
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:57,849
grammar this is point one similarly here what
is the probability that vbz derives likes

35
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:07,420
this gives me point four and like that i will
fill all these entries now this is ok

36
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,560
now what i want to show you is that how do
i fill the next entry that is zero two what

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:21,099
is the probability with which the non terminal
n p derives the sequence a pilot now if you

38
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:29,160
remember a single non terminal can derive
two non terminals two terminals only via two

39
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,520
non terminals so it has to first derive x
zero one x one two then each will individually

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:47,800
derive an pilot so how do i fill in this probability
value so this would be probability that n

41
00:04:47,800 --> 00:05:08,130
p derives d t n n times probability dt derives
a times probability n n derives pilot ok this

42
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:15,080
probability getting my pcfg so this probability
if i see in my grammar this is point three

43
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,980
this probability i have already filled in
is point three and this probability also i

44
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,460
have filled in this is point one
so the probability that n p derives a pilot

45
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,780
here comes out to be nine times ten to the
power minus three and that's what i fill in

46
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:42,100
here ok and in the same manner you will fill
in all the entries if it is five it means

47
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:48,610
the probability will be zero ok and if there
is a non terminal here that means there will

48
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,320
be certain probabilities and this you can
get by finding out probability individually

49
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,410
for each of this and multiplying the probability
of this rule so that way you can incrementally

50
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,010
built all the stable from in a bottom up fashion
we are starting from the first element then

51
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:11,479
in the next one and so on ok so remember nearly
same as we did in the last class only the

52
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,590
the probabilities and the multifunctional
probabilities will change suppose you do that

53
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,380
for this example this is what you will find
out so these are the rule probabilities that

54
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,850
you will come up with so i will i will encourage
all of you that you should try this on your

55
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:35,229
own and see that you can get the same set
of values that have been shown in the slide

56
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:41,150
so now coming to the next question i am given
the pcfg as my grammar how do i find out what

57
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:48,370
is the probability of the sentence ok so one
simple solution you can always find is that

58
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,100
i find out all the possible parse trees find
the probabilities for each of the parse trees

59
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,860
and add those up that is one way ok but this
you might be inefficient if there are very

60
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,490
huge number of parses trees if you remember
one of the introductory slides we said that

61
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,180
as you increase the number of words in the
sentence or the number of phrases the number

62
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,240
of possible parses increase roughly exponentially
ok there was something like peclet number

63
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,380
with this their group and it can go go two
hundred plus parses so you don't want to sum

64
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,400
this get the probability individually and
then do addition you want to do something

65
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,960
more efficient than that and how do we do
this and that's why we use this inside algorithm

66
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,260
ok that is one of the main topics of this
lecture so what is the inside algorithm and

67
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:41,169
this is some dynamic programming algorithm
based on the concept of inside outside probabilities

68
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,759
so now i will i will try to introduce what
is that inside outside probability so this

69
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,180
this is very centre to understanding this
lecture as well as the next lecture so so

70
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,820
let us try to understand what is the concept
ok and just so that it it helps you this is

71
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,800
very very similar to the concept of forward
backward algorithm that we did in the case

72
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:11,130
of h m f s so what is inside outside probabilities
so i can this is parameterized for certain

73
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:18,069
node of my tree so what you see in this figure
i have a sentence with words w one to w m

74
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:24,990
ok and n one is the non terminal you can think
of it as the sentence non terminal that derives

75
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:36,509
the whole sequence of words using my grammar
now i am putting a parameter here that is

76
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:43,370
n j n j is one particular non terminal it
can be n p v p or so on so what i am saying

77
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:51,010
here assume that there is a non terminal n
j that derives the sequence w p to w q ok

78
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:57,351
again p and q are arbitrary you can take any
p starting from one to m minus one ok so what

79
00:08:57,351 --> 00:09:05,760
i am parameterized here is that this n j derives
the sequence w p to w q so now with respect

80
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,010
to that i am defining what is my inside probabilities
and what is my outside probabilities so you

81
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,580
can as such you can guess this is something
outside of that and this is something inside

82
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,300
of that
so how do i define my inside and outside probabilities

83
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,730
so outside probability is that it is starting
from n one i can derive the sequence w one

84
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,540
to w p minus one i can derive this non terminal
w sorry n j and the sequence w q plus one

85
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,770
to w m this is my outside probability and
inside probability is given this n j the probability

86
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,339
that i can derive w p to w q as per my grammar
ok and it will then follow the same sort of

87
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,649
ideas that if i can multiply inside and outside
probability that will give me something like

88
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:57,570
the probability of the sentence parameterized
by this particular jth non terminal so formally

89
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,330
that's how i can write the outside and inside
probabilities

90
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:06,860
outside probability alpha j p q that is standard
format which we can write p q denotes the

91
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,320
sequence w p w q on which this parameterized
and j denotes the particular non terminal

92
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,390
n j here so the outside probabilities probability
of generating w one to w p minus one yes and

93
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:26,330
j p q and w q plus one to m given by grammar
and inside probabilities probability of generating

94
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:34,380
w p to w q given n j ok so this is also parameterized
by n j p q because it is arriving w p to w

95
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:42,269
q and in my grammar so that's why i define
my inside and outside probabilities

96
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:49,360
now let us take a simple example i have the
sentence the gunman sprayed the building with

97
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:57,190
bullets ok and here your p q is four and five
so you are parameterization with respect to

98
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:03,450
this sequence the building ok so accordingly
this will be particular non terminal that

99
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:11,320
is n p that is deriving the building so now
what do we mean by inside probability so inside

100
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,830
probabilities what is the probability that
this non terminal n p at this location derives

101
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,959
the sequence the building this is my inside
probability ok and what will be the outside

102
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:31,000
probability here that is starting from n one
i can derive the sequence the gunman is sprayed

103
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:43,339
this n p and with bullets this is my outside
probability ok so yeah so this is what we

104
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:49,519
have defined the outside probability alpha
n p four five would be the probability of

105
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,290
this sequence the gunman is sprayed n p four
five and with bullets given my grammar and

106
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:01,390
the inside probability beta n p four five
would be the probability for deriving the

107
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:08,600
building given n p four five and grammar
now this is this definition of inside and

108
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,620
outside probabilities now how do i actually
compute this inside and outside probability

109
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:22,050
given this sentence and suppose our grammar
is also given to me how do i compute that

110
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,160
so for inside probability so let us see this
is the definition of inside probability beta

111
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:35,269
j p q is probability of deriving the sequence
w p to w q given non terminal n j p q in my

112
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:42,010
grammar now so i am i will be deriving both
these probabilities in a iterative manner

113
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:49,360
so what will be the base case here so the
base case here if you see would be when p

114
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,670
and q are same that is i am deriving a single
terminal from a non terminal ok and that you

115
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,800
can find out very easily if your grammar is
in the chomsky normal form so what is the

116
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,779
particular non terminal that derives this
term so this would be the base case for deriving

117
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:15,260
a single term base and then i will go in a
bottom up fashion derive the inside probabilities

118
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:23,140
for higher and higher sequences so the base
case here is when p is equal to q so beta

119
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:30,940
j k k would be probability of w k k given
n j k k and g now w k k is a single word ok

120
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,480
sequence from k to k and i can immediately
find out what is the role in my grammar that

121
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,350
derives this word w k k and i put this rule
probability here and this will give me the

122
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:49,940
this probability beta j k k
now as an example suppose here my word is

123
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:58,660
building ok so this is the fifth word so i
am computing beta for five five and suppose

124
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,940
i take n j is equal to n n that works in non
terminal derives this word so you can compute

125
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,890
beta n n five five as the probability with
which the non terminal n n can derive this

126
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,950
word building ok and this is easily given
by my grammar so this is my base case

127
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,520
now what will be the inductive case so i have
to go bottom up so lets take a generic beta

128
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,730
j p q how do i derive it in terms of the smaller
values so let us try to do that so if i am

129
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:41,790
given i have to compute beta j p q what is
that mean it means that i have a non terminal

130
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:55,060
n j and that is deriving a sequence w p up
to w q ok and i have to compute this probability

131
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:03,580
given n j the probability of the sequence
w p to w q because i am conducting in a i

132
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,100
am doing it in a bottom fashion and i have
to use the proper lower values

133
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:20,450
so i will first say n j can give me some n
r and n s now n r will derive from w p to

134
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:27,730
some w d so very generic case so this can
be any possible n r and n s that my n j can

135
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:36,220
derive and again i can go from w p to any
w d so you can see what can d vary from to

136
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:47,300
so d can vary from p up to q minus one ok
and this n s gives me w d plus one up to w

137
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:54,940
q this is my recursive case ok now how do
i write down this probability so i will say

138
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:03,750
this is first the probability that n j derives
the rule the non terminal the n r and n s

139
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:14,709
so probability n j derives n r n s times this
probability now here n r is given so what

140
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:20,360
is the probability is that n r given n r it
derives from w p to w d again you can compute

141
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:28,980
this using so you can express this using inside
probability that is beta r p d similarly this

142
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:40,670
one beta s d plus one to q ok now this is
for the particular variation that i have shown

143
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,790
but in general d can vary from p to q minus
one and they can be any possible n r and n

144
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:54,670
s so i will have to write down this whole
thing let me call it x so i have to say this

145
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:13,250
can vary from p to q minus one and all possible
n r n s ok and i will put x here so this is

146
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:21,409
my inductive step
now what do i mean by parameterization over

147
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:30,460
by all possible r s and all possible d so
if you take the case of this simple phrase

148
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:37,279
the huge building ok so what do i mean by
various d so if i have this this is the huge

149
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:47,999
building by variation of d i mean whether
i am composing it by the huge and building

150
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:55,429
or the and huge building two possible variables
of d ok and what do i mean by parameterization

151
00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:01,799
over all possible n r and n s so that the
particular non terminal that derives this

152
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:10,529
whole thing can be support this n p it can
come via say n p gives me d t n n this is

153
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:19,239
one possibility this is dtnn this is and or
we can make n p gives me d t n n s this is

154
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:25,340
another possibility so this is the parameterization
over all possible n r n s and this is over

155
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:33,820
out possible d's
so now we have seen that you can compute it

156
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:40,700
for the only the terminals first and then
the bottom up to compute it for other values

157
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:49,940
ok so now if you do a simple example so this
is again similar to what we have seen earlier

158
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:57,979
so i am given this pcfg and this is my sentence
and i want to compute the inside probabilities

159
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:03,989
here so how do i go about out it and you looking
at the table you can see that we will doing

160
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:09,239
something very similar to what we did in the
case of c k y algorithm ok

161
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:16,629
but now we will focus on filling up what is
the inside probability of deriving this from

162
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:46,479
the particular non terminal ok so let us just
try to filling some entries here 

163
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:59,929
ok let me lets try only the first two this
is astronomers and this is saw ok and i have

164
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:10,500
to fill in the inside probabilities so this
would be so now in the in the in the way we

165
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:19,419
defined inside probability this would be one
one this would be two two sequence from word

166
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:25,519
two to word two this would be sequence from
word one to word two

167
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:36,499
so now when i define beta j p q so here p
and q are both one so i have to find out what

168
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:43,059
is the non terminal that derives this word
astronomers now if i see a grammar and these

169
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:48,509
derive astronomers with the probability of
point one so i can fill fill the inside probability

170
00:20:48,509 --> 00:21:01,710
here beta n p one one one one you need not
to write and i am just writing here is equal

171
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:09,149
to point one ok because one one is already
defined by the particular cell where we are

172
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:14,580
similarly let us go to two two two two is
saw if i see the grammar n p derives saw n

173
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,830
p derives saw ok so there are two different
so that's where you can see there are two

174
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:30,120
different j that are possible here so one
is beta v another is beta n p and this has

175
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:41,119
the probability of one and this has the probability
of zero point zero four using my grammar

176
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:49,000
now suppose i have to fill this one one two
what is the particular non terminal that will

177
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,080
derive this this whole thing again similar
to what we were doing in c k y is the something

178
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,412
that derives n p and n p if i see my grammar
nothing derives n p and n p ok in the right

179
00:22:01,412 --> 00:22:12,799
hand side now is there something that derives
n p followed by v or again there is nothing

180
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,659
here n p followed by v so this will come out
to be zero ok suppose there was something

181
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:25,600
that derives n p followed by v so i would
simplify find out what is the non terminal

182
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:33,700
that is deriving this and put the probability
as this times this times the rule probability

183
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,619
ok
similar to what we were doing in the case

184
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:41,080
of c k y for probability context free grammars
the only difference here is that if there

185
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:51,039
are multiple splits for same non terminal
i will add all these ok so so for example

186
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,869
the same non terminal so i am taking a hypothetical
case suppose the same non terminal x derives

187
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:07,409
n p followed by v and also n p followed by
n p if the probability of p one is the rule

188
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:16,799
probability this is a probability of p two
so i will put here beta x and this will be

189
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:26,509
p one times zero point one times one plus
p two times zero point one times zero point

190
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:31,370
zero four and that's why i fill in all the
entries ok

191
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,990
so i will i will take care of all the possible
ways in which this particular non terminal

192
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:42,629
we can derive this ok so again so if you keep
on doing that this is what you will see so

193
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:48,379
we had filled in this entry and this entry
and this entry but i will encourage you to

194
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:52,940
fill in all the entries of this table and
see if you can get to this particular term

195
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:59,330
what is the probability of the sentence generating
this whole thing ok so now if you see this

196
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,369
table you also get the answer for the second
question it how do i find out the probability

197
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:11,721
of my sentence use the same probabilities
and compute beta as for one to m or one to

198
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:20,080
five in this case that will give you the probability
of this whole sentence ok so this was about

199
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,500
inside probabilities
now how do i compute the outside probabilities

200
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,179
ok so if you remember this is analogous to
what we did in the case of forward backward

201
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:34,389
algorithm so now inside probabilities we are
computing bottom up and this will be computed

202
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:40,549
top down and what will be the base case base
case would be very very simple that is can

203
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:46,509
i generate the whole sequence one to m ok
and now because this is the grammatical sentence

204
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:52,389
we are assuming so only the first non terminal
that is sentence or you can write it as n

205
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:57,580
one can derive this whole sentence nothing
else can derive so that's why the base case

206
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:05,659
will be alpha one one to m is one if the so
this j is one otherwise it will be zero

207
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:12,309
so if i write down alpha one one to m will
be one and alpha j one to m will be zero if

208
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:17,879
j is not equal to one if j is equal to one
denotes the starting non terminal like s or

209
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:26,860
n one whatever ah we were using the notation
form so now this is the base case now what

210
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:34,779
will be the inductive case so inductive case
would be i have to compute it in a top down

211
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:40,619
fashion ok so can you think of inductive case
here

212
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:48,210
so now what i am showing here what are the
two possibilities of this inductive case so

213
00:25:48,210 --> 00:26:00,649
let me just show it quickly on the paper so
i have to compute alpha j p q ok and i am

214
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:09,299
going top down now what is the alpha j p q
i have a non terminal n j that derives w p

215
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:25,020
to w q ok and everything else w one to w p
minus one and w q plus one to w m is there

216
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:33,330
in the sentence now i have to do it in a top
down manner so i have to use the probability

217
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:40,440
from the upper label so i would say what is
the non terminal that derives this n j with

218
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,429
some other non terminal and again this can
be either left child or right child lets take

219
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:53,389
the case where it is the left child so i would
say there is some non terminal n f it is starting

220
00:26:53,389 --> 00:27:05,489
from p up to you have to take some w e p e
that derives n j and some n g and what is

221
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:13,440
the parameters here this is p q this would
be q plus one to e ok so this is deriving

222
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:21,229
q plus one to e
now i am doing it top down so i have already

223
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:29,730
completed this that is the probability of
this sequence this and w e plus one up to

224
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:35,379
m this i have already obtained now what i
have to obtained in alpha j p q is the probability

225
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:52,740
of w one to w p minus p n j p q and w q plus
one to w m this is what i have to obtain now

226
00:27:52,740 --> 00:28:02,119
here i have already obtained this probability
and n f p e and somewhere w q plus one to

227
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:10,529
w m this i have obtained so how do i write
it in in this in terms of n f p e i will say

228
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:22,389
this is n f p e ok although they may be different
possible n f p e we will do the summation

229
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:33,570
over that later times probability of this
will probability n f gives you n j n g already

230
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:40,309
we have come here and this is deriving w q
plus one to w e because i need these probabilities

231
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:43,589
also
now now how do i how do i write down this

232
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:53,639
expression this we just did in the previous
case so this is nothing but the inside probability

233
00:28:53,639 --> 00:29:06,659
ok so this would be beta g q plus one to e
ok and that gives me the probability for this

234
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:13,159
particular extraction although there are various
summations that we will have to do same case

235
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:19,830
we can do for the when this is the right child
then n g will come here and this is a huge

236
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:25,730
very very similar ok
so if you look at then in this case so this

237
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,779
is where it is a left child this is where
it is a right child in this case as we did

238
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:38,460
it is alpha f p e probability of this rule
and inside probability of this whole sequence

239
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,720
and what are these summing over all the possible
f and g's ok because it can be any non terminal

240
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,690
that is arriving this n along with any other
non terminal and what can what what is something

241
00:29:51,690 --> 00:30:00,070
else that can vary my e can vary from q plus
one up to m so i am summing over all the possibilities

242
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:04,089
and you can similarly see for the for the
second case

243
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:10,370
so now so so what is important here you can
compute this outside probabilities by using

244
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,179
inside probabilities on a that means you have
to first compute the inside probabilities

245
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:19,020
use that to compute the outside probabilities
ok although computing outside probabilities

246
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,859
much much more difficult than computing inside
probability if you want to do that on paper

247
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:29,020
that's why we did a example only for the inside
probabilities

248
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:36,000
now coming to this point so remember when
i were saying that we have done this parameterization

249
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,690
of inside and outside probabilities such that
if we multiply that we had something interesting

250
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:46,839
that we can use further and the goal here
is also to compute the rule probabilities

251
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,799
that is my third question i was asking that
how do i compute my rule probabilities of

252
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:58,610
pcfg we will come to that in the next lecture
let us quickly see what do i get if i multiply

253
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:05,379
the alpha j p q with beta j p q ok so if i
do that so alpha j p g is nothing but probability

254
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:11,990
of w one to w p minus one n j p q and w q
plus one to m given my grammar and beta j

255
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,809
p q is probability of w p q given and n j
p q in the grammar so you multiply both of

256
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:25,149
these you will see that w p q can come here
and n p q is also retained here ok because

257
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:32,709
here i need n j p q to be given that is already
given to me before so this is the multiplication

258
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:39,879
ok now what does this say so it is saying
if i multiply alpha j p q with beta j p q

259
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:48,629
i get the probability of generating this whole
sequence of words w one to w m and that a

260
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:53,830
non terminal n j derives w p to w q ok given
my grammar

261
00:31:53,830 --> 00:32:01,090
now suppose i want to find out the probability
that any possible non terminal derives from

262
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:07,751
w p to w q there is some consistent spanning
from w p w q in that case i will have to sum

263
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:18,839
over all possible j's that i can achieve by
summing over all possible j`s for alpha j

264
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,259
p q into beta j p q this is the probability
of the sentence and that there is some consistent

265
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:31,740
is spanning from the w word p to word q ok
and this is you can write in this manner ok

266
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:38,909
this is the same thing n one derives w one
m and n p q derives w p q this and this are

267
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:43,950
the same thing except this particular index
of n j

268
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:52,360
now if we go back to the previous example
that we took what does that mean so probability

269
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:59,080
is that this whole sentence the gunman sprayed
the building with bullets and that there is

270
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,310
some consistent spanning from word four to
word five that means there is some non terminal

271
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:10,440
they derive this sequence the word four to
word five how do i obtain it this should be

272
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,929
summation over all the possible non terminals
n j such that this happens the gunman sprayed

273
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:24,999
the building with bullets n j p q given g
and this is nothing but alpha n p four five

274
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:31,959
beta n p four five so here i am taking all
possible j's j can be n p v p and so on

275
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:38,289
so whatever non terminals so i multiply alpha
beta for a particular j and add overall the

276
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:43,979
possible j that gives me this probabilities
so even here it may not be very very clear

277
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:51,049
what is the actual use of obtaining this particular
probability value ok how do i use it further

278
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:56,399
and that is what we will see in the next lecture
that how do i use this inside outside probability

279
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,339
for learning the rule probabilities of my
probabilistic context free grammatical ok

280
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:07,059
so i hope this concept of inside outside probabilities
is clear to you and then we can see how do

281
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:08,520
use that further in the next class
thank you
