00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,910
so welcome back for the third lecture of this
week ah in the last lecture we had discussed

2
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,480
top down and bottom up parsing approach and
then finally we came up with the dynamic programming

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,030
approach of ah using c k y algorithm and we
converted a grammar to chomsky normal form

4
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:44,199
now how once my grammar is converted to chomsky
normal form how do i c k y algorithm work

5
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,700
so this is the idea
so i will take a sentence i have n words in

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,530
my sentence so you will think about n plus
one lines that are separating them is starting

7
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:03,350
from zero to one ok and so once you have done
that any x i j will denote words between line

8
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:11,399
i and j and so you you will build up a table
such that any x i j will contain all the possible

9
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:17,860
non terminal that can derive words between
the lines i and j ok and you do that bottom

10
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,630
up
so so what i am saying you have word one word

11
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:34,930
two up to word n in your input stream so you
assume some lines like zero one two n minus

12
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:45,719
one n ok so for example x zero two is words
w one w two and so on so now what you will

13
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:56,850
you do you build up a table ok and table will
be some sort of triangular table 

14
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:12,140
so this can be zero one two so this element
will denote x zero one what are all the non

15
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,540
terminals that derive this word between zero
and one similarly here you will write x one

16
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,530
two and so on suppose they want a three words
so this is x two three ok so we will write

17
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,120
down all the non terminals that derive this
you first fill this then you will go next

18
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:43,299
step x zero two x one three ok and once you
fill this you will use x zero three the final

19
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,310
one ok
now what is the where are we using the fact

20
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:59,900
that ah this grammar is in c n f chomsky normal
form i will make sure fact that at any point

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,530
this can come from only two non terminals
or a single terminal so at this point when

22
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,240
i am seeing at a as a individual word so zero
one will always be a individual word similarly

23
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,740
for one and two so this will come by a rule
capital a goes to small a a rule of this kind

24
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,849
ok so i will find out all the non terminals
that derives this terminal thats how i will

25
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,740
fill the diagonal elements the first diagonal
elements

26
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:32,560
next time this cannot come from a single terminal
because they are two words ok so this has

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,440
to come from two non terminals so i will find
out if there is a rule that gives me these

28
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,389
two non terminals and thats where i am using
chomsky normal form ok so finally when i am

29
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:52,959
here i will see if the sentence as generate
the whole sentence so i am catching all the

30
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,330
possible intermediate steps here so that i
denoted i have to ah do certain in again and

31
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,000
again ok
so this is the simple home exercise so in

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,710
the in the last lecture we had given you a
grammar in chomsky normal form now take the

33
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:14,120
sentence book the flight through houston and
use the c k y algorithm to find a parse tree

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:26,560
for that ok ah so but what i will do i will
do an example in todays class also so that

35
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,720
it becomes become more much more comfortable
with using c k y algorithm

36
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:42,000
so lets take this example a pilot likes flying
planes and the grammar is given to you ok

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:57,830
so let do that in the way i had explained
so zero one two three four five there are

38
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:15,669
five words ok and this is the line 

39
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:21,520
ok and now you should understand how do we
denote these elements so this is x zero one

40
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:31,389
this is denote only the first word this is
x one two x two three x three four x four

41
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:40,159
five this will be x zero two words between
zero to two x zero three x zero four x zero

42
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:51,250
five x one three x one four x one five x two
four x two five and x three five now i have

43
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,570
to fill here what are different non terminals
that filled each of the individual elements

44
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,750
x zero one
what is x zero one my word is a so a pilot

45
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:13,289
likes flying planes so is there a non terminal
that derives the word a and if you see the

46
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:22,749
grammar dt derives a ok so you can fill in
dt here dt derives a pilot n n derives pilot

47
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:33,639
likes v b z derives likes flying so you see
there are two non terminals vbg and j j they

48
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:42,560
derive this and planes n n s ok so filling
the diagonal element is very easy the first

49
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,729
diagonal elements then you go the next step
x zero two now x zero two can come from x

50
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,570
zero one and x one two as a break up of these
two points so is there an non terminal where

51
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,870
or is there a rule in my grammar when the
right hand side i have dt followed by n n

52
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,699
and if you see your grammar yes n p gives
me dt followed by n n so i can fill in n p

53
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:12,249
here x one three comes from x one two and
x two three yes x one three pilot likes so

54
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:17,900
it comes from pilot and likes so any non terminal
that gives me n n followed by v b z and if

55
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,389
you see there is no non terminal so i will
fill in empty here

56
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:37,460
similarly and if v b z followed by vbg no
anything from v b z followed by j j x three

57
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:53,740
five v b g followed by n n s yes v p and j
j followed by n n s n p ok so there are two

58
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:02,099
possibilities so fine this row is done this
diagonal is done now we go to next step now

59
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:08,779
how do i derive x zero three a pilot likes
now thats why i am using the chomsky normal

60
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:15,409
form i cannot derive it at the sequence of
three non terminals because each individual

61
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:21,599
non terminal can give me at most not at most
exactly two non terminals ok so what are the

62
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:31,910
two places from which it can come so one possibilities
i can break x zero three as x zero one and

63
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:41,950
x one three one word into two words or x zero
two x two three there are two possibilities

64
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:48,800
ok so i have to check individually each of
these possibilities x zero one x one three

65
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:59,370
x zero one is dt followed by null so this
is already gone ok this is no non terminal

66
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:08,450
x zero two is n p followed by x two three
is v b z so n p followed by v b z is there

67
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,540
a non terminal when the right hand side i
have np followed by v b z ok and if you see

68
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,641
your grammar there is nothing so this is also
null so here it is null there is no non terminal

69
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:29,200
let me derive a pilot likes ok
now pilot likes flying one to four so again

70
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:40,730
one to four will be one two two four or one
three three four so one two two four one two

71
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,810
is n n two four is null so this part is null
one three three four one three is null so

72
00:09:46,810 --> 00:10:00,200
this becomes null also two five will be two
three three five and two four four five so

73
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,460
two three here is v b z and three five is
v p is there something that v b z and v p

74
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:19,520
yes v p this means v b z and v p two four
four five two four is null ok so this is my

75
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,660
v p similarly now you will go to x zero four
now what are difference which you can break

76
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:35,830
x zero four now zero four again you to break
it in a sequence of two non terminals so it

77
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:47,520
can be zero one followed by one four or zero
two followed by two four or zero three followed

78
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,870
by three four there are three ways
so let us see one by one zero one is d t one

79
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:01,270
four is null so this part is gone zero two
is empty and two four is null this part is

80
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:13,450
also gone zero three is null already so this
is null ok one five one five can be one two

81
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:25,700
two five one three three five one four four
five one two and two five yes n n followed

82
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:40,890
by a v p so is there something in my grammar
n n followed by v p no so this is gone 

83
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:47,590
similarly one three followed by three five
one three is null ok and one three is null

84
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,700
so this is gone one four followed by four
five one four is null so this is also gone

85
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,560
so this is also null now the only thing remain
is x zero five

86
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,660
now how can i fill x zero five what are different
ways so let me write down here zero five can

87
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:16,920
be zero one followed by one five zero two
followed by two five zero three followed by

88
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,481
three five zero four followed by four five
ok zero one followed by one five zero one

89
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:31,630
is there one five is null this is gone zero
two followed by two five zero two is there

90
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:40,130
and two five is also there this is n p followed
by v p and this is a sentence in my grammar

91
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:49,840
so s gives me n p v p so this is one possibility
already so that means this sentence is grammatical

92
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,520
at least there is one s that derives this
but are there any further ah s

93
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:06,040
so for that we have to look at other possibilities
zero three three five ok this is null and

94
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:18,920
zero four four five is null ok so fine so
if you see there i think we made one mistake

95
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,620
here there should have been another v p in
this case ok so there is v p one v p two and

96
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,130
then there will be s n p v p one and n p v
p two so yeah i will search that look back

97
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:38,170
into this ah calculation we did and see where
where we made a mistake ok but everything

98
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:47,010
else is the same that we did here so there
are two different s in which this ah sentence

99
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:55,960
can be parse two different ways so now once
you know this i will say that use the previous

100
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:03,050
ah example so that is book the flight through
houston from the other grammar and try to

101
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:12,200
get its parse tree
so now in this example what we saw there are

102
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,250
two possibilities so can you think of the
possiblit[ies] why there are two possibilities

103
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:30,140
in this case a pilot likes flying planes ok
so whether he likes to fly the plane or whether

104
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,060
he likes to see flying planes something like
that so there are interpretation thats why

105
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,050
there are two different parse parse edge of
this sentence so each individual parse with

106
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,350
we will denote one particular interpretation
now by using this context by this c k y algorithm

107
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:52,740
we denote all the possible parse trees using
my grammar but i have no way of saying which

108
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:59,050
parse is more probable than the other parse
i cannot assign some probabilities to them

109
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,800
ok so something if i have so this is the sentence
the man saw the dog with the telescope it

110
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,510
has two different interpretation in terms
of two different parse edges whatever i have

111
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,930
covered till now it cannot tell me which parse
is more probable than other

112
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,230
so now we would like to have a way in which
we can assign them the probabilities that

113
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,400
this parse edge is more probable than the
other and for that what we use is called probabilistic

114
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,740
context free grammars so this is simple extension
of context free grammar where in addition

115
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,020
to whatever we have seen in context free grammar
each rule is also signed some probability

116
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:43,480
ok so as you see in the formulation it is
t n s and r they are exactly same as what

117
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,320
we had seen in the context free grammar plus
there is something called p so i am assigning

118
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,000
a probability distribution over the rules
and only the constraint here is that from

119
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,940
a given non terminal the lateral side the
probability generating anything should add

120
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,540
up to one so if there are five possibilities
if i add all the five possibilities the rule

121
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,320
for all the five possibilities they should
add up to one ok so this is the constraint

122
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,250
so probability in the rule gives the gives
the probability of each rule p r so the constraint

123
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,860
is for all x in non terminals probability
of x to gamma for all the possible gammas

124
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:31,780
should add up to one ok
so let me give you an example so so this is

125
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:42,250
one simple cnf sorry simple p c f g in chomsky
normal form ah so so what do you see here

126
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,380
from s there is only one rule s goes to n
p v p ok so because there is only one rule

127
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:55,030
it has a possibility of one from from v p
there are two rules v p can give v followed

128
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:04,679
by n p or v p followed by pp so so the constraint
is that for the possibilities of these two

129
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,560
rules should add up to one so that is what
is happening here the first rule has a possibility

130
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,980
of point seven second rule has a possibility
of point three so there is two add up to one

131
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,929
now pp gives me p n p only one rule with pp
on left hand side so this is the possibility

132
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:26,549
of one p gives me only with again possibility
one v gives me saw this is the possibility

133
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:30,159
one
now all these rules in the right hand sides

134
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:35,809
are starting from the n p n p giving to me
n p pp all the words let us call as like astronomers

135
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,410
ears and so on so all these should add up
to one and you can see that this actually

136
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,419
happen point four plus point one point five
point six eight point seven two point nine

137
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,870
and one so all these possibilities are adding
up to one so this is the constraint that is

138
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,809
being followed the rules have the same format
as in context free grammar but you shall have

139
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:58,510
a possibilities now how does it help it helps
in that i can now assign possibilities to

140
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:06,500
each individual parse tree
so suppose this is one parse tree astronomers

141
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,860
for the sentence astronomers saw starts with
ears how do i find the probability of this

142
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,380
parse tree this is the parse so i know s gives
me n p and v p yes this is the first rule

143
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:25,279
that i am applying now as my p c f g the probability
of this rule is one s giving n p v p is one

144
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:31,480
so i have this one here n p giving astronomers
deriving astronomers is probability point

145
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,540
one v p deriving v and p is probability point
seven v giving saw is one n p giving n p vp

146
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,590
is point four n p giving stars is point one
eight and so on these are the rule probability

147
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:51,480
as per my grammar as my p c f g so what i
will do i will just multiply all these probabilities

148
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,809
one times point one times point seven times
point one times point four times point one

149
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:02,629
eight times point one eight this is my probabilities
of this parse trees

150
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:09,299
and if i get a second parse tree where instead
of v p giving me v and n p v p giving v p

151
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:15,179
followed by pp i can again compute its probability
by multiplying its corresponding rule probabilities

152
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:23,519
and i can find the probabilities of both the
parse trees individually ok

153
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:33,100
so now how do i use that to compute the probability
of the tree that is simply the product of

154
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,330
the probabilities of all the rules that i
used to generate this and probability of assignments

155
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,769
and the probability sentences is nothing but
find out all the parse trees and the probabilities

156
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:52,350
of the individual parse trees and just sum
them up ok so probability of this sentence

157
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,549
is the sum of the probabilities of the trees
that have this as their yield that is another

158
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:05,159
way of saying that those parse trees are used
to generate this particular string

159
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,629
so in the first case i had this sentence and
they were to parse trees i can compute the

160
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:16,929
probabilities of individual one so p t one
and p t two i can find out and then to find

161
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,559
the probability of the whole sentence i just
add up these two probabilities p t one plus

162
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:27,679
p t two and that gives me the probability
of this whole sequence

163
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,519
similarly if i have another sentence like
book the dinner flight and as as per a different

164
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,950
grammar i can compute the parse trees the
two parse trees compute the probabilities

165
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:44,409
for the individual one ok so parse tree one
here book the dinner flight is one point six

166
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,860
two into ten to the power minus six and book
the dinner flight will have a probability

167
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,039
of two point two eight into ten to the power
minus seven so one thing i can immediately

168
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:58,760
see is that the first one parse is more likely
interpretation than the second one

169
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,659
lets look at some of the features of probabilistic
context free grammars so why we started with

170
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:10,700
this formulation so we said that using the
context free grammar given a sentence we can

171
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,630
find out all the possible parse trees but
you are not able to assign any probabilities

172
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:22,279
to that so by using p c f g if for a given
string the number of parse trees are increasing

173
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:27,279
i can also assign the probabilities for each
individual parse tree so that gives me some

174
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:34,119
plausibility which parse tree is more probable
than the other one for the given string so

175
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:40,929
this is important but at the same time we
should understand that although by using p

176
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:46,730
c f g i can compute what is the probability
of the sentence by taking all the parse trees

177
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,610
taking the individual probabilities and adding
them up this is this just not giving a very

178
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,240
good ah plausibility of the sentence ok this
is only looking at the structural factors

179
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,571
not some lexical co occurrence
so in general to find the probability of the

180
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:09,869
sentence you would prefer to use language
model than a p c f g p c f g is good only

181
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:15,619
for find the probability of a parse tree which
parse is more probable than another one yes

182
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:23,840
if the it it helps in some cases like in real
text you might find some grammatical mistakes

183
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,929
so p c f g will allow that but will give you
very very low probability so in one case you

184
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,710
can also probably find out which sentence
has some grammatical mistake if the p c f

185
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:44,309
g is giving it low probability and yeah this
is something that i said earlier so in practice

186
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:48,679
this is not good for modeling the probability
of the sentence ok language model is much

187
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:56,159
better than p c f g so why is that the case
so a simple example is if we have the same

188
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,570
sentence i have two different trees one is
smaller than the other the smaller tree will

189
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,090
always have a higher probability than the
larger one because all the probabilities are

190
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:10,289
less than one and for a larger tree you are
multiplying the probabilities ok

191
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:16,309
so yeah the take away here is that you would
use p c f g to find out what what are all

192
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,809
the probabilities for different parse trees
for a sentence ok and try to choose the best

193
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:27,559
one
so now once we have this formulation of p

194
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:32,169
c f g there are some interesting questions
that we would like to explore using that so

195
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:39,240
suppose i am given a sentence w one m ok i
am given a grammar g and there are various

196
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,730
parse trees t is one of those so what is the
most likely parse for this sentence given

197
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,990
the grammar so which parse is tree t gives
me maximum probabilities argmax of probability

198
00:23:51,990 --> 00:24:01,039
given the sentence and the grammar ok then
what is the probability of the sentence probability

199
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:08,519
of the sentence given by grammar and then
finally how do we learn the rule probabilities

200
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,480
of my grammar g which these are the three
interesting questions that we would like to

201
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,580
answer in the next lectures
so for example how do i find the most likely

202
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:24,259
parse of a of a sentence so one simple solution
is find out all the possible trees and take

203
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:30,539
the one with the highest probability but is
there any efficient method for doing that

204
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:35,990
what is the probability of a sentence again
i can find out probabilities of the individual

205
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,470
parse trees add them up this gives me the
probability of the sentence but can i do at

206
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:48,289
by extortion numerating all that and adding
it or is this some other method and finally

207
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:52,480
there is some interesting question that how
do i learn the rule probabilities in the grammar

208
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,440
g and the answer to this will be similar to
what we saw in the case of ah head and markov

209
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,220
models so there are so there are they will
be again two ways of running the parameter

210
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:12,010
one will be when the ah i am given the corpus
and some labeled parse trees i can use them

211
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:17,379
to find the probabilities under the scenario
where i am given the corpus but not the parse

212
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:22,869
tree i am only given the grammar grammar in
the sense cfg not the rule probabilities then

213
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:28,220
how do i learn the parameters so this will
be again very very interesting topic and there

214
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:34,200
you can use some ideas where that i had shown
earlier for the ah algorithm

215
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,789
so in the next lecture we will start trying
to answer some of these questions

216
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,580
thank you
