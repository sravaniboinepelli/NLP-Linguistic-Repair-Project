1
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:24,429
so hello everyone and welcome to this course
on natural language processing so in this

2
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,369
course we will we will be having this course
for twelve weeks and in which week will have

3
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,910
five modules so today we are starting this
course and this is the first module ah first

4
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,370
lecture for this week and this is basically
the course introduction what what are the

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,850
different topics we will be covering this
course what are the different text books that

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,300
you might be using for this and some other
details that might be necessarily for you

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:55,799
ok so firstly my contact so if you have certain
questions you can only you may also write

8
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,530
to me on this email i d so this is my official
email id and you might also want to visit

9
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:09,189
my web page that is provided in in this link
so in this course we will have two teaching

10
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:14,710
assistants so amrith krishna and mayank singh
both are my phd students and they are working

11
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,040
on n l p so so idea is that they can they
will be able to help you with any of the queries

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,760
that you having during this course and they
will also help you with all the assignments

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,310
that we will providing this course so they
will so in addition to me they will also be

14
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:39,190
your primary contacts during this course
so in this course we will be following two

15
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,650
of the main so very very popular books on
natural language processing so so jurafsky

16
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:52,700
and martin is a very popular book so title
is speech natural language processing so so

17
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,020
this is your second addition but there may
be also be the third addition that is available

18
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,350
so you might you second additional and any
later additional for of this book for this

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,630
course
then there is a book by manning and schutze

20
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,590
on foundations of a statistical natural language
processing by m i t press that is again a

21
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,900
very very popular book and we will be using
concepts from both the books along which some

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,120
other sources in this course so you can you
can try to avail any of these two books or

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,730
both the books if possible and with with the
course some addition reading from this book

24
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:32,150
will be helpful for ah addition the the concepts
and getting a good class on the course

25
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,290
so in addition to the books you you will also
get the lecture slides so from the lectures

26
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,060
that i will be taking this course all those
slides will be made available to you and if

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,879
necessary i will also point out to some additional
ah a person and any other material that might

28
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,980
be helpful for you so that also will provide
on the on the course website and we also thinking

29
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,549
of giving you some ipython note books
so so that you can also do some sort of hands

30
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:05,650
on so these note books are so you will be
using python for doing certain text twicing

31
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,999
tasks and so this will we will also provide
you some basic instructions on how to start

32
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,329
teaching this ipython note books so they will
also very very helpful for this course because

33
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:23,739
this is n l p is mostly and hands on so its
its not very very nice just to have an l b

34
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,609
course to have only the theory theoretical
knowledge its important also so that given

35
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:38,720
a problem you can a start doing some processing
over that ok so in in for the evaluation so

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,129
we will have assignments that will be given
after every week throughout the course so

37
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:49,879
that will constitute twenty five percent of
the of the whole evaluation of for this course

38
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,239
ok so they will assignments will be on the
lectures that are that are covered in this

39
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,780
course also we might also give you some sort
of programming assignments time to time in

40
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,849
this course
so they will be all been in python plus so

41
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,799
there will with the final exam that will be
constituting seventy five percent of the overall

42
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,389
weightage that mean the after the end of this
course so what are the different topics that

43
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:22,170
we will be covering this course so this course
we have we have starting with so the basic

44
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:28,970
topics that are required for understanding
all the concepts in in n l p then we will

45
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,970
move to some applications so what are the
various basic topics that we will be covering

46
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,000
this course so we will start with the text
processing so given a text data how do you

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,750
start doing some processing over that so that
may include how do i tokenize it that is breaking

48
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,050
in to various words how do you i start doing
lemmatization stemming find out the route

49
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,320
words and so on
then we will be start with very foundational

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,250
topic on language modelling that is how do
i use the ordering information inside the

51
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,600
language for developing certain applications
so how can i use this statistics then we will

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:13,190
go to the morphology that is what to different
categories of words and given a text data

53
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,490
how do i start finding out different categories
of words so what are the different applications

54
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:25,010
or algorithms that i can i can use then we
will go to the to high level finding out what

55
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,760
are different groups in the sentence how they
are connected to each other in the topic of

56
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,100
syntax then we will move to se semantics where
we will have various models of semantics using

57
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,640
lexicon and lexical semantics and using the
distributions and distribution semantics and

58
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,340
we will also touch upon the topic on word
embeddings that is very very popular ah as

59
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,300
of now
so finally we will also cover topic mortis

60
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,130
so how do you find out what are the various
topics that i have covered in a given text

61
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:00,390
data and how do you i make use of this in
various applications then after cub once the

62
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,720
basic topics are covered we will also devote
some time especially in the last three weeks

63
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,730
on how do you a start applying these basic
concepts for certain applications so n l p

64
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,360
is very very broad topic and you will see
enumerable applications where you can apply

65
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,040
all these concepts but to give you an idea
so we will take three very very interesting

66
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,110
and important application in n l p so will
start with the topic of entity linking and

67
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,140
information extraction this will be the first
application that will be cover then we will

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:37,450
go to text summarization and classification
finally we will end up with opinion analysis

69
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,540
and opinion mining so this will be the the
final application that we will be cover and

70
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,180
we will hope that whatever basics and some
aspects of application that we cover in this

71
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,890
course will help you in taking any new problem
and starting to think of euron approach for

72
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,330
solving that ok so idea of this course is
that you you are not only aware of what are

73
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,320
the tools available you can use them on your
own but also you are you know what are the

74
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,580
basic algorithms what are the foundations
and given a new problem you can think of a

75
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,260
think of a approach on your own and build
your own tools so that is the the goal of

76
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,910
this course and as i said earlier this is
million introductory course but all the basics

77
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,080
that that are required for dealing with any
advanced topic will be covered

78
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,030
so if you take any new research topic that
is not covered in this course the idea would

79
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,910
be whatever knowledge is covered will help
you to at least start understanding the topic

80
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:46,920
and then go deep in to that so now so if you
works on why do we need to study n l p ok

81
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,870
so so what does so what is n l p so n l p
is all about processing text data so now you

82
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,671
see in in on on everywhere so you can find
out this abandons of text data ok now you

83
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:03,730
can also see the text is the largest human
knowledge a pastry that you that you have

84
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:09,160
so so what are the various sources where you
find all these knowledge in in text data so

85
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,400
you can think of all the wikipedia articles
for instance all the news articles that come

86
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,380
dealing ok so all the scientific articles
they are available and text format patents

87
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,750
all with the all the social media all they
have tweets facebook posts and everything

88
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:29,810
is also available in the text format
so now this abundance of text data and this

89
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:37,130
is all quite un structured ok so to be able
to make use of this information and build

90
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,370
some rise applications you should know how
to process this data and thats why n l p comes

91
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:49,130
in to picture so ya so with recently with
all the tweets facebook posts comments over

92
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,370
all the news articles everywhere and quora
so you have an abundance of text data and

93
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,230
you should you should be aware of some tools
by which you can do certain analysis of this

94
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:09,760
data so now so so this is one thing that we
have a lot of text data available this is

95
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,810
another another problem that so so much data
is available that is unstructured but this

96
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,110
is not in the single language for example
in its not in english so so this gives you

97
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,130
some this chart gives you some a statistics
so so what you will see here so this is from

98
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,019
november twenty two thousand fifteen how many
millions of users are there in on internet

99
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,959
and different languages you see yes english
users are the highest at the same time you

100
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,029
have lots and lots of chinese users and then
spanish and arabic and again you see large

101
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,860
number for all the rest language that are
not covered in this chart

102
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,699
so you will not be able to understand all
the languages so and you will needed tool

103
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:57,069
that can take any given language and try to
put it in the language that you can understand

104
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:02,600
ok so some sort of tools are are necessary
so that they can automatically find out what

105
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,100
is the language provided in this document
how do i ah translate to some languages that

106
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:15,259
i know and so on doing some information summarization
over there and translation ok so you need

107
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:25,170
n l p in all of these aspects so now so this
lecture i will just end with dealing saying

108
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,360
what is n l p ok so what is the main goal
of n l p as such what for this research field

109
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,910
of n l p so if you think about it so so there
is a very very broad ah scientific goal of

110
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:45,069
this field of n l p and that is can be understand
language can we have a very very deep understanding

111
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:49,800
on how human process language can we teach
computers how to understand language

112
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,699
so that is i will say a deep scientific goal
behind all the n l p so can we teach computers

113
00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:00,810
on understanding language and they can may
be respond with humans the way humans to and

114
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,740
and so on so that is very very longest and
in goal of n l p so this we would says mainly

115
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,220
a fundamental scientific goal ok i want to
have a deep understanding of broad natural

116
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,939
language but with that we also be very very
practical and engineering goal and what is

117
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:26,760
that so the goal is that so yes there is lot
of text it available even if i do not know

118
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,939
how to make computers understand that fully
can i still make use of this data to build

119
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,639
some very very nice applications that that
will be helpful for people in they really

120
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,139
life and that you can see from you own life
so how many different applications that you

121
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:48,139
might be using ok starting from the search
that is very very very ah common application

122
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:55,699
that every one uses and so you will see in
in a lot of other applications starting from

123
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:59,910
news recommendations and and all that that
your using a new really life ok

124
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:07,510
so so this is the engineering goal for n l
p that is can i design implement and test

125
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,809
systems that will process natural language
and that i design for very very practical

126
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:18,249
applications that we can use in day to day
life so this is the engineering goal of n

127
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:24,779
l p and that is what we will be mainly focusing
in this course and n l p ok so all the concepts

128
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,990
and and algorithms that we will discuss in
this course are mainly focus to words various

129
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:37,240
engineering applications of n l p so so with
that i again welcome you for to this course

130
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,499
so so in the next module or the next lecture
we will discuss what what do we actually do

131
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:48,319
in n l p by taking some simple examples ok
thank you
