00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:25,060
so welcome back for the second lecture of
this week so in the last lecture we were ah

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,510
discussing viterbi decoding for h m ms and
in the end we discussed the problem of learning

3
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,650
the parameters of h m ms and we say that when
the label data set available we can simply

4
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:42,430
estimate using maximum likelihood estimate
ok by by the label data set but if the label

5
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,440
data set is not available then how do we actually
learn the parameters of the system and we

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,860
said we will be using some sort of expectation
algorithm and in this particular case this

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:02,190
is called baum welch baum welch algorithm
so baum welch algorithm as i was saying this

8
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,040
is a well known e m algorithm to estimate
the maximum likelihood for the parameters

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,650
of the h m m ok so ah so what are the parameters
of h m m that you want to estimate ok let

10
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:25,440
we just formally define them and then we will
see how do we estimate them using buam welch

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:34,150
so in in the h m m model so we have a hidden
state at every time point and an observation

12
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:40,920
variable ok so here i am using capital x t
to denote the random variable that is the

13
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,390
hidden state and capital y to denote the observation
variable ok so both x t and y t can take many

14
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,700
many different values for our part of speech
tag is each x t can take one of the part of

15
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,650
speech tags and each y t can take one of the
possible votes ok

16
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:06,490
so this my my ah hidden variable hidden state
x t and the observation y t the parameters

17
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:14,870
are a b and pi that we discussed last time
what is a so a is my state transition matrix

18
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,260
so given given that the previous state was
i what is the probability that the current

19
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:30,281
state will be j ok so here the t as such does
not matter what matters is that the state

20
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:37,890
j occurred after state i at any any given
time point then i have the parameter pi that

21
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,750
is what is the probability that this particular
state is starts the sequence so probability

22
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:52,490
of x one that the the first state beam the
i x state that is my pi a and then thirdly

23
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:59,000
i have the emission matrix so where the entries
are what is the probability of observing this

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,959
particular word or this observation given
the current state ok so this i am denoting

25
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,640
like b j y t at the state j what is the probability
of i am meeting the observation variable or

26
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,340
observation y so either three parameters three
set of parameters that parameters i have learnt

27
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:29,660
so
now what is given to me ok so i was saying

28
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,020
that we are given the coppers not labeled
but the seek the word sequences are given

29
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,740
so this is this can be seen as y observations
are given different sentences are given i

30
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,090
knew what are different words occurred in
the sentences so i can say that i am given

31
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,440
a set of observations in data ok so here i
can say that i am given a set of observation

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,940
sequences that the first observation was the
word y one then y two up to some y t where

33
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:03,110
y t denote the end of the sentence so i am
given a set of observation sequences and my

34
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,840
aim is to find out the optimal set of parameters
theta that maximize the probability of this

35
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,290
observation so these observation sequences
so that is where i am using buam welch algorithm

36
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,620
find out what are the optimal set of parameters
theta that will maximize the pro probability

37
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,639
of likelihood of observing this observation
that's why i am using expectation maximization

38
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:38,870
algorithm so what so what is the main intuition
of of e m so idea would be i want to estimate

39
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:49,000
the parameters a b n pi so what i will do
i will start with some random initial ah probabilities

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,160
for all all these parameters i will initialize
them with some random values so i have all

41
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,590
these probabilities ok
now using this initial values i will try to

42
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:09,840
find out what are the probabilities of various
state paths so i give on a given sequence

43
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,620
what is the probability that a particular
state would have occurred given these parameters

44
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,910
so once i have obtained the probabilities
of different state paths or different states

45
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:29,050
a different point now i i got this this probability
i will use that again to compute to re to

46
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,490
re estimate my parameters so i will get started
with theta zero i get some theta prime ok

47
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,650
now i will again use the theta prime to complete
my state paths probabilities again use that

48
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,370
to compute recompute my parameters until it
somehow converges ok

49
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:54,790
so this is my trade devaluate first use some
parameters theta to get some likely from the

50
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,770
data for the hidden variable here that is
the states once you have that that likelihood

51
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:10,050
or the probabilities use that to compute my
my theta ok so so what we are doing here so

52
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:17,670
i am start starting by choosing some initial
values of the parameters a b m pi ok and then

53
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:24,040
i have to repeat the following steps until
convenience what is that firstly determine

54
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:32,000
what are the probable paths ok that x t minus
one that t minus one object point i see the

55
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,880
state i at tth i see the state j and so on
what is the probability of various state paths

56
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,100
now once i have these will teach count the
number of times so what is important expect

57
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,450
a number of times because we are only computing
probabilities we are not finding the actual

58
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:56,090
paths so count the expected number of transitions
a i j as well as the expected number of times

59
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:03,400
various emissions b j y t m eight ok so using
these state paths can you do that yes i know

60
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,780
what is the probability of x t minus one is
equal to i h t is equal to chain i can use

61
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,940
it to compute an expected value for a i j
and this is what we will be doing so will

62
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,960
compute a i j similarly i al already know
the observation so i can also computes unexpected

63
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,460
vanish for b j y t what is the probability
that i see objection y t for the particular

64
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:32,800
state j so once i computed this a i j and
d j y t i will again estimate my parameters

65
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,580
theta using these these computed values ok
now i will go back in the loop i have this

66
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,060
theta i will compute the probabilities of
various state paths ok again compute a i j

67
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,009
b j y t and again compute theta and i repeat
that until convergence

68
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:59,210
so now what is so so all these are interesting
here like firstly once you are given some

69
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,650
set of parameters theta it can be either the
initial parameters or some intermediate parameters

70
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:11,550
how do you actually compute different the
probabilities of different paths how do you

71
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:19,039
actually do it and for that we use a forward
backward algorithm that is the ah main concept

72
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:28,639
of this algorithm ok so let us see what is
this forward backward algorithm ok so in forward

73
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:37,449
by back backward algorithm we have a forward
procedure and a backup procedure ok so so

74
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:46,600
far for explaining let me just take show it
on paper ones so what is happening i am observing

75
00:08:46,600 --> 00:09:01,790
this sequence y one y two y small t y t minus
one y t this is my observation ok and correspondingly

76
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,570
so you can say this is y one is equal to y
one first observation y two is equal to y

77
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:17,590
two and so on ok and correspondingly there
are states so is my observation and then there

78
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:24,880
are states so there will be some state x t
this is y t observation is my state x t is

79
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,880
equal to y it can be any of the possible states
x t now what do i do in this forward backward

80
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,690
algorithm i compute two different probabilities
one i called as the forward probability this

81
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:51,560
is the probability of observing y one to y
t plus and x t is equal to i give my parameter

82
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:00,010
theta so this is my alpha t for the i of the
state the probability that i am observing

83
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:08,020
y one to y t and at t h point the state is
i given a parameters theta

84
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:20,019
ok y one is equal to y one y two is equal
to y two y t is equal to small y t and x t

85
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:28,920
is equal to y given parameters theta this
is my forward ah probability then i compute

86
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:43,100
a backward probability what is that this is
the probability of observing this given this

87
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:57,240
state ok 
so this is my alpha i t and there is beta

88
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:10,510
i t that is probability that y t plus one
is small y t plus one up to capitol y t is

89
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:20,680
y t given x t is equal to i and theta so these
are two different probabilities that i state

90
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:29,279
so what do you see here so i am taking just
a state at a particular time t a particular

91
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,589
state time
now why do you actually compute this alpha

92
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:41,970
i t and beta i t how does that help now i
have these probabilities i can simply multiply

93
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:52,820
these alpha t times beta i t to get the probability
that i observe the sequence and the i of the

94
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:01,610
state ok and to actually compute the probability
of c saying that at t h time point the state

95
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,430
was i i can margini marginalize it by all
the possible states that can happen at time

96
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:15,370
t ok so i can multiply sigma i t beta i t
and divide by all the possible sigma j t alpha

97
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:23,980
j t n beta j t to compute the probability
of seeing state i at time point t and this

98
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:32,800
is thats how this forward and backward probabilities
help ok so you will see that in detail ok

99
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,040
so right now just the formulation so i am
this higher the sequence i divided in two

100
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,579
parts for a given t this is state i i have
the forward probability alpha i t and a backward

101
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:50,870
probability beta i t alpha i t is this further
sequence and the state beta is the ending

102
00:12:50,870 --> 00:13:00,870
sequence given this is state the previous
state x is equal to i ok so now so this is

103
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:07,070
my alpha i t ok so now how do i compute these
values of alpha i t i want to compute this

104
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:12,420
for all possible i's and all possible values
of t so this is a forward probability so i

105
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:21,240
have to start with the first point so how
do i actually compute alpha i one ok what

106
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:29,700
is that so alpha i one from this equation
which probability of observing y one is equal

107
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:41,482
to y one ok and x one is i given theta so
what is the probability of x one is equal

108
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:59,089
to i given theta that is pi i ok this is my
pi i and this probability would be emission

109
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:14,920
from x one from the either state so this will
be b i y one ok so this is how i will compute

110
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,730
the initial one alpha i one for all possible
states i

111
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:30,580
now at some point of time ok at some point
t plus one how will i compute alpha j t plus

112
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:44,079
one given the previous alpha i t i have completed
so alpha j t plus one ok so t plus one means

113
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,279
the probability of seeing the sequence up
to white t plus one and the state x t plus

114
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,459
one is j so how can i compute that using the
previous alphas so i have the i have the previous

115
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:09,700
alpha that gives me this so alpha i t at the
previous time step i had some state i i have

116
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:18,600
the transition from i to j so times a i j
and now i have the emission for the t plus

117
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:36,500
oneth observation that is b j y t plus one
and this i can obtain from any of the previous

118
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:45,160
states so i have to sum over all the possible
states ok so from all the previous states

119
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,540
at the t h time step i can be an estate i
i have the transition probabilities and the

120
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,850
emission probability for t plus one and that
is how i can compute sigma alpha j t plus

121
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:05,820
one from all the alpha i t h so this is how
you can compute your alpha then because a

122
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:13,770
manner starting from alpha i one
what will you do for your betas ok so this

123
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:20,510
is a backward processor so what is my beta
i t this gives me the probability of ending

124
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:29,940
the sequence with y t plus one two y t given
the state i a time this is my backward procedure

125
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,880
now this i again compute aggressively in alpha
i was starting from the first word i was campaigning

126
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,780
alpha i t in betas because the backward procedure
i will first compute beta i capital t t is

127
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:54,360
the end of the sequence and what will the
beta i t so beta i t would be probability

128
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:01,130
of so given that previous the t h point state
is i having a sequence on t plus one but there

129
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,020
is no word from t plus one so this will always
be so this is always be one this will be a

130
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,870
null sequence so this is always one
now i have to compute it recursively for all

131
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:24,169
other beta i at time point t ok so here i
am going backwards so you assume that you

132
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:30,380
have completed all the beta j at time t plus
one and you want to use that to compute beta

133
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,859
i at time point t how will you do that so
this is very similar to what you did in the

134
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:44,509
case of alpha so we can see this so this is
beta j at time t plus one transition probabilities

135
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:51,729
from i to j and the emission probabilities
probability for the t plus oneth observation

136
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:57,980
and you sum over all the possible states at
times so very very similar to what you did

137
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,340
in the case of forward procedure so that's
what you will do in the backward procedure

138
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:11,259
for computing beta h in a recursive manner
ok so now you have the a way that given the

139
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:20,070
set of parameters minus theta you can compute
all this alpha and beta ok so all the alpha

140
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:26,990
i t is an beta i t you can complete now remember
what is the next step in the algorithm you

141
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,769
want to find out what are the best possible
paths or what is the probability of various

142
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:35,859
paths that is what we intended by doing this
alpha and beta let us see how exactly we can

143
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:42,070
compute these probabilities of various paths
so i want to compute the probabilities of

144
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:59,600
say probability x is equal to y given my observation
and parameters theta also i want to compute

145
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,749
x t is equal to y and x t plus one is equal
to j given y n theta i want to compute both

146
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:14,850
of this so if i can compete both of this i
can i can compute all the parameters i can

147
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,159
complete my transition probabilities using
that i can compute my initial probabilities

148
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,760
using that by taking t is equal to one and
you can also compute my ambition probabilities

149
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,389
so now my problem is once i commuted alphas
and betas can i compute these probabilities

150
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:46,350
ok so that is what we will see next
so i am giving these some some names so firstly

151
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:55,359
i have this gamma i t that gives me the probability
that at t th point the state is i given my

152
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:03,340
observations y plus theta parameters and similarly
i have zeta i j t that is probability that

153
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:09,989
at t th point i have state i t plus one point
i will change a given by n theta so gamma

154
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:16,659
i t is written terms of multiplication of
alpha i t and beta i t ok divided by summation

155
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:23,529
over all possible sigma z alpha j t and beta
j t over all possible change so now how how

156
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:31,539
do we actually come up with this ah equation
of gamma i t and and zeta i j t let us look

157
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:46,099
at it ok so here i want to compute probability
x t given x t is equal to y given y n theta

158
00:20:46,099 --> 00:21:09,059
so now i will computed using probability x
t is equal to y y given theta divided by probability

159
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:15,759
y given theta ok the simple conditions ok
so if you follow that theta this is nothing

160
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,980
but x t is equal to y given by x t is equal
to y y divided by probability y this simple

161
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:32,340
the condition probability row
now this one i am writing is summation j is

162
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:43,940
equal to one over n equal to one to n probability
x t is equal to j y given theta ok so now

163
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,539
you can see the symmetry in this equation
now what i what i have to show that alpha

164
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:57,149
i t times beta i t is probability x t is equal
to y y given theta and that is very easy because

165
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:08,519
what is alpha i t this is probability y one
to y t plus x t is equal to i what is beta

166
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:18,639
i t probability of y t plus one to y capital
t and now x t is equal to y is already given

167
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:27,460
for beta and this is given my parameters theta
ok and this is what we are seeing here this

168
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:34,309
is my alpha i t times beta i t and this is
marginalizing over all possible states that

169
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:39,029
time bind so this will be sigma j equal to
one to n alpha j t beta j t so this gives

170
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:48,609
me the equation for gamma i t similarly you
can see for zeta i j t that is for probability

171
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:58,260
of x is equal to i x t plus one is equal to
j y given y n theta so in the same way you

172
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:10,610
can write it as probability x t is equal to
i x t plus one is equal to j y given theta

173
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:20,070
divided by probability y given theta that
will marginalize over all possible i n j ok

174
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:34,229
and you will say probability x t is equal
to i x t plus one is equal to j y given theta

175
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:40,309
for all possible values of phi n j
now what we have to show that is that this

176
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:51,409
is actually this formula ok now so what is
this so you are given state at time point

177
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:58,849
t and time point t plus one so what you are
actually doing is that using the forward procedure

178
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:08,510
from y one to y t and you will also get the
state at state i at time point t and you will

179
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:16,019
use the backward procedure because you are
given the state at time t plus one state j

180
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:26,479
beggar procedure for from y t plus two up
to y capital t ok so this is what is cap captured

181
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:40,859
in alpha i t and this is captured condition
on j in beta in beta j t plus one then you

182
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:50,379
will compute the probability of transition
from i to j that is a i j ok and y t plus

183
00:24:50,379 --> 00:25:02,289
one given j that is your d j y t plus one
ok so this equation is nothing but probability

184
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:08,190
of x t is equal to y x t plus one is equal
to j y given theta this whole sequence is

185
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:15,320
there and these two states are also and similarly
you can see for the for here this is over

186
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:23,450
all the possible values of i and j ok
so i hope this is clear that once i have completed

187
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:30,779
all the possible alpha and beta and the parameters
are the previous parameters of the ah we can

188
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:39,239
compute this gamma i t and zeta i j t th that
are probability of state at a given time and

189
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:48,109
a sequence i and j at time t and t plus one
ok this we can compute using alpha and beta

190
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:55,919
now coming to the last part that is once i
computed some probability is over by possible

191
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,159
state paths how do i estimate my parameters
again ok i have started with some initial

192
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:10,889
parameters computed this now i want to re
estimate my parameters theta so how do i do

193
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:24,990
that so now i have to estimate my pi i a j
and b i v k so how do i estimate this pi i

194
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:34,179
is probability of seeing the state i at time
one so now from these parameters which one

195
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:42,399
can give me this value probability that x
one is equal to i the second get from gamma

196
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:53,929
a one ok that is that can give me my pi i
is probability that at x x one is i so this

197
00:26:53,929 --> 00:27:02,840
is to estimate my pi next thing i have to
estimate is transition probabilities probability

198
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:13,840
of going from state i to state j now i have
completed this ok so how do i compute my e

199
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:29,679
i j e i j would be at all possible times how
many times you are having the sequence i n

200
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:48,580
j so this will be summation over t zeta i
j ok jee ji zeta i j t is each i followed

201
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:59,909
by j divide by over all the times when you
are seeing this t ok so when you are seeing

202
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:08,690
the state i and this you can compute using
your gamma i that is summation over t gamma

203
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:19,339
i t and that will give me my a i j all the
possible cases where all the all the probabilities

204
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:26,109
of i and j having together at any point divide
by all the probabilities of anyway this is

205
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:37,219
my a i j and similarly how can you compute
your b j say v k that is at state j you are

206
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:45,100
emitting v k how can you estimate that so
for that you have to find out whenever you

207
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:52,580
are in state j is the observation actually
v k how many times we are in state j by the

208
00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:00,759
observation is we can divide by number of
times you are in state j ok so this is so

209
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:09,999
here the nominator is easy that is number
of times you are so this b j v k a number

210
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:19,880
of times you are in state j this is gamma
j t numerator number of times or the probability

211
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:28,580
that you are in state j times the observation
is actually v k ok

212
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:35,919
now so at time t the observation is small
y t ok so i can use some sort of a simple

213
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:43,299
notation or indicator function one v k is
equal to y t so indicator function ok what

214
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:53,539
do indicator function so one v k is equal
to y t will be one if v k is actually y t

215
00:29:53,539 --> 00:30:01,450
and zero otherwise listen to my indicator
function so now whenever if v k is y t whenever

216
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,649
i observe y t i will add it otherwise it will
be zero and this is this will give me the

217
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:18,480
emission probabilities so i could estimate
my pi a i j as well as b j v k using this

218
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,070
zeta i j and gamma i i which i computed using
my forward backward probabilities and this

219
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:31,419
is one complete pass of this algorithm ok
now i have these parameters i will plug these

220
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:37,909
again to compute alphas and betas again compute
my gamma and zetas and again estimate the

221
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:44,100
parameters until it converges ok and this
is the buam welch algorithm for for landing

222
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,369
the parameters of h m m when the label data
set is not available so this gives you a very

223
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:58,149
nice handle on ah h m ms so you can apply
h m ms when you have the label data set very

224
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:03,570
easily by by learning the parameters directly
from h m ms maximum likelihood estimate and

225
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:09,919
data beta decoding but even if you get a new
ah problem or a new language furtherer you

226
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,889
have to compute part-of-speech tax but you
do not have the labels you can use it this

227
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:19,100
buam welch algorithm to estimate the parameters
of a h m m and then you should have enter

228
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:26,070
the code to to actually given a new sentence
find at part of speech tag sequence

229
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:32,019
so and you can use that for any other sequence
label task so this completes our discussions

230
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:38,349
on h m ms that are that were one of the very
popular models for ah this part is fish tagging

231
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:44,090
in many other sequence labeling task but they
they have certain limitations and that is

232
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,739
what we will discuss next then that what are
these limitations and how do some other models

233
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:54,570
some so we will go to now some discriminative
classifiers like maxim and role models they

234
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:01,690
get rid of these limitations so this is for
h m ms let us lets let's look at maxima into

235
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,619
the models in the next lecture
thank you
