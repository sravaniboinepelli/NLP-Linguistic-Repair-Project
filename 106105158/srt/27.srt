1
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,090
so welcome back for the sixth week of this
course so so we had already started our discussion

2
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,810
on what is parsing so this is the topic in
syntax and we talked about a constituency

3
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,220
parsing approach ok by using the probabilistic
context free grammars so now we will use a

4
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,460
slight different version of parsing is called
dependency parsing so where ah instead of

5
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,380
what we did in the case of constituency parsing
where we were finding out what are the different

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,360
word groups in terms of noun phrases adjective
phrases verb phrases we will directly find

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,050
out what is the relation between any two words
in a sentence ok so dependency parsing notion

8
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:07,060
has ah picked up a lot in in research field
in the last few years but as such it is origin

9
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,640
is is very very old many many different linguistic
traditions for example in in ah for the sanskrit

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,959
the famous sanskrit grammar [FL] that are
the dependency relation between verb and different

11
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,630
ah words in the sentences

12
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:33,520
so for example if i have a sentence like ram
eats apple a simple sentence i will see the

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,509
verb eat is the main main verb here and what
is the relation of ram so ram is subject of

14
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:47,020
this verb and apple becomes an object of this
verb ok so like that i am so here i am trying

15
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,849
to directly say in this sentence if i am in
different words are these related somehow

16
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:56,429
and what is the relation between them so this
is my dependency structure

17
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:01,319
so in this lecture we will see what is the
what is the formal way in which we can define

18
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,259
dependency structure what are different linguistic
constraints etcetera that we we need to impose

19
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,150
in this structure and then we will start talking
about the some of the models that are very

20
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:21,680
popular for getting the dependency structure
it's starting from the sentence

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,349
so this kind of tree we have seen in the case
of phrase structure also called the constituency

22
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,540
structure so what we have seen here i have
a sentence economic news had little effect

23
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,540
on financial markets so they are different
group of words as single unit so economic

24
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,709
news make a noun phrase similarly this whole
thing makes a verb phrase and they together

25
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,569
make a sentence so like that what we have
seen here which words are grouped together

26
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,170
ok and how this whole sentence has been arranged
that's what you see in a phrase structure

27
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,319
now how dependency structure different so
for the same sentence let us look at the dependency

28
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:07,879
structure so here what are you seeing now
this also looks like a tree but the nodes

29
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:15,030
here are the words themselves not the phrases
and different words has been have been connected

30
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,920
by some edges and they label by some relation
like had and news are connected and the relation

31
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,230
is subject saying that news is a subject for
the verb had similarly economic and news are

32
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:35,650
related so this is economic is a noun modifier
for the word news and so on lot of different

33
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,569
words are connected in this sentence so in
general what we are seeing two different words

34
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:46,469
in a sentence are connected by certain relation
and this is a directed sort of relation so

35
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:53,769
economic and news are related by saying economic
is a noun modifier for news

36
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:00,260
so so in general how we can define a dependency
structure so we take another sentence here

37
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:07,330
he sent her a letter ok so what you are seeing
here so first you are seeing some five six

38
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,469
words or if you take the punctuation so they
are five words as such he send her a letter

39
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:17,440
five individual words so what do i do in dependency
structure so we are connecting the word in

40
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,139
the sentence by putting arrows between the
words so i am putting an arrow between sent

41
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,450
and he and these two are connected so he is
a subject for sent similarly i am putting

42
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,680
an arrow between sent and her so in that her
is in indirect object for sent

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,060
now what do these arrow show which arrows
are showing means the relations between words

44
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,490
and are also typed by some grammatical relation
so they are saying these some relation and

45
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,800
what is the relation it is the subject relation
he is a subject for sent and what do these

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,870
arrows connect they connect a head word like
sent with a dependent word like he and there

47
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,889
are some in linguistic there are some other
terms like head can be called governor superior

48
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:10,920
regent and the dependent can also be called
a modifier inferior or subordinate and usually

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:19,450
as you would see the dependency which will
form a sort of tree structure

50
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:26,310
now so what is important here so dependencies
you have a head that connects to a dependent

51
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:32,289
by an arrow so arrow points from a head to
a dependent so now are they said some formal

52
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:37,410
criteria for saying in a sentence if two words
are connected what will be a head and what

53
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,710
will be the dependent so there are some idea
they may not be applying everywhere but may

54
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,800
be applying it certain points so you will
see some say examples for some of these so

55
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,129
what are these criteria for defining a relation
between head and dependent in a construction

56
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:59,699
so first criteria you can see is that the
head determines what is the syntactic category

57
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:07,680
of the dependent or sorry what is syntactic
category of the whole construction ok

58
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,970
so like if i see this construction a letter
the whole whole syntactic category governs

59
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:21,740
simply by the word letter ok and that's why
the head itself so the word letter becomes

60
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,030
the head and this word letter can also replace
the whole construction c so in place of the

61
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:35,639
whole thing a letter i may also write simply
letter now d specifies h so that means d is

62
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,159
giving further specific information about
h so i if i write only if i say only letter

63
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:46,580
may not be as specific as saying a letter
ok so all these determines they give some

64
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:56,949
additional information similarly here ok so
sent is the head and letter is the modifier

65
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:02,430
so if i just simply say he sent it's not very
specific to whom did he sent so there i have

66
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,050
to specific particular modifier he sent her
similarly what did he sent so there i have

67
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:15,669
to put the word letter so what you are seeing
the dependence is further specifying my head

68
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,410
now in some cases so so head is always obligatory
i need to put head like letter is import[ant]-

69
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,379
is necessary to put but d i i may put it optional
in some cases so i may also say he sent her

70
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:34,200
a letter ok so so d the dependent may be optional
in certain cases

71
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:42,870
now the the word the head word it selects
my dependent d and it also determines further

72
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,370
the dependent is obligatory or not and in
some cases the form the grammatical form the

73
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:55,470
d takes will also dependent on my head so
this is also ah called the agreement or government

74
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:02,229
government in the case of linguistics so that
ah so like the the form that use for your

75
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:08,570
verb in in your construction will be similar
to the form of the subject and object that

76
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,540
we are using also with the linear position
of the dependent is specified with respect

77
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:21,690
to the head h
so so for example so ah so english follows

78
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:32,890
this as we are construct right so you get
the subject first then the verb then the object

79
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,050
so what we have seen the linear position of
the of the dependent is determined with respect

80
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,360
to the head so if i know the verb has come
so i know subject will come to the left and

81
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,450
object will come to the right like i want
to say sentence where i am saying i am eating

82
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:57,190
something who is eating the subject will come
on the left i eat and what do i eat say an

83
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,950
apple that will come on the right so the position
of the dependent it is specified with respect

84
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:11,080
to the head whether it is to the left or to
the right

85
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,760
now there are some cases that are clear where
you can easily find the dependencies so so

86
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,060
for example if i look at the exocentric and
endocentric constructions what do i mean by

87
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:31,640
endocentric and exocentric so endocentric
construction one where one of the identity

88
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:40,710
here can can actually fulfill the whole grammatical
function of the whole of the complete construction

89
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,140
so if you look at this verb and adverbial
relation verb modifier

90
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,960
so what is the example suddenly affected this
may doing some grammatical function suddenly

91
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,080
affected and why it is endocentric because
only one word here like affected can fulfill

92
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,780
the whole grammatical function for the whole
construction suddenly affected suddenly is

93
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:07,140
simply modifying that same way for non modifier
like financial markets so markets can fulfill

94
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:15,071
the grammatical function for whole thing financial
markets it's not the case for exocentric construction

95
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:21,200
like verb and subject
so if i take affect and the news affected

96
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,031
cannot fulfill the whole grammatical function
for news an affected i need to have the word

97
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:34,270
news so this is called exocentric endocentric
one word can fulfill the whole function exocentric

98
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,522
a single word cannot but the cases of exocentric
what will become the head and what will become

99
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:44,160
the dependent like if i have the verb and
subject i know that verb will become the head

100
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,180
and subject will become the dependent same
way verb and object verb becomes the head

101
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,960
and object becomes the dependent in the case
of endocentric again the particular word that

102
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,310
can fulfill the whole function can become
the head and the other word can become the

103
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:05,000
dependent so here verb is the head affected
and suddenly becomes the dependent similarly

104
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,090
here markets is the head and financial becomes
the dependent

105
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:17,460
now if you just try to compare what is the
difference between a phrase structure a representation

106
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,770
and dependency representation what we see
is that in phrase structure we have very explicitly

107
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,950
denoting what are the phrases these non terminal
nodes and labels in the case of dependency

108
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:35,190
relations what are the explicit denoting they
are words but what are the relation between

109
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,100
different words and what is the grammatical
category of each individual relation so in

110
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,100
the case of phrase structure i denote what
are phrases and what are the structural categories

111
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,350
like noun phrases verb phrases and so on in
the case of dependency structure what do i

112
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:58,350
represent what are the various head dependent
relations like in the case of directed arcs

113
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,610
and what are the functional categories that
are what are the different arc labels that

114
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,380
i am giving to various arcs in my dependent
relation

115
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:16,170
now formally can i define what is dependency
graph so i have to define it for ah the words

116
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,770
in my sentence so formally i can say that
the dependency structure can be defined as

117
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:31,380
a directed graph consisting of a set v of
nodes and a set of a of arcs now this is a

118
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,070
very generic way in which you define a graph
in a graph you have a set of nodes and set

119
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,870
of edges that are connected different nodes
now is there something more than this in the

120
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:47,020
case of dependency structure now in the case
of dependency structure so this is the labeled

121
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:54,120
graphs so what are the nodes in my graph the
nodes in the graph denote the word forms the

122
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,430
word that i that i am counting in my sentence
and with that i might also have some ah annotations

123
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,380
like what is the part of speech category of
these words i can also put in my nodes and

124
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,720
what are the edges they are labeled edges
with the dependence relations what is the

125
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,380
dependency time if it is subject object noun
modifier verb modifier etcetera

126
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,830
and some simple notations that we used for
this is that ah if i am saying that word w

127
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:34,020
i is connected to word w j with dependency
relation d i can use this arc w i d w j it

128
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:45,120
says that w i is the head w j is the dependent
and d is the relation ok so i can say ah eat

129
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:57,370
subject and i or he ok there is another way
in which i can note the arcs by saying this

130
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,630
is the headword this is the dependent word
i am denoting an arc from a head to dependent

131
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,210
word and putting a label on top of that this
is another way ok and this is equivalent to

132
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:16,330
saying w i d w j are in the set of arcs
there are some other conditions like ah if

133
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:22,450
i say that from i this relation from i to
j direct relation then i can i can write that

134
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,160
i j in my set of arcs so i am not writing
the dependency relation here but i am saying

135
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:36,430
i and j are in the set of my dependency relations
similarly i can do a closure of this saying

136
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:43,930
that i from i there is a there is path to
j ok so that means in any number of steps

137
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:52,050
i can go from i to j if and only if either
i and j's are equal or there is some case

138
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,110
such that i go from i to k and from k you
can go to j any number of cases this is simple

139
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,240
this is very standard way in which you define
the closure relations

140
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,130
so with the dependency labels i can define
a single dependency or i can also define a

141
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,990
closure of that so i hope this notation is
clear so once we have this notation what does

142
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,760
the total form of conditions that we can put
on the dependency graph so on the graphs so

143
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,000
that the denoted dependency graph for a sentence
what are the formal conditions

144
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,300
so what are the formal conditions so first
condition is that the dependency graph that

145
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:39,870
g that i get is connected ok by connected
what do i mean there is ah there is no node

146
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:48,300
in my graph that is isolated from the whole
graph or in other words if i take any any

147
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,460
word in my graph any node in my graph i can
always find a another nodes such that either

148
00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:01,220
that node has an incoming link from that previous
node or an outgoing into that node ok so it

149
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,800
is connected to some of the node in the graph
attached it's not isolated so this is the

150
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,010
simple condition for saying when the graph
is connected

151
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,610
the second condition is that my graph is acyclic
there is no cycle in the graph so what do

152
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:26,131
i mean by that if i say that from a node i
i have a label i have a path or i have a dependency

153
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:34,610
from i to j there is no way i can have a path
from j to i so there is no way i can go back

154
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,260
to i if i am going from i to j i cannot go
from j to i either directly or by following

155
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:48,450
something k and this so this is not allowed
ok so because this will make a cyclic i to

156
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,550
j j to k k back to i so cycles are not allowed
in the case of dependency graph similarly

157
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:01,230
if i can if i can show the previous one that
means that if i take a node i in my graph

158
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:07,990
it should not happen that and they are connected
and i is isolated i can always find some nodes

159
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,150
such that either there is an incoming edge
or there is an outgoing edge one of these

160
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:20,439
they cannot be both right because of this
principle of a cyclicity

161
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:26,870
what is the third one third condition says
that my dependency graph g obeys the single

162
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:38,380
head constraint so what is single head constraint
so single head constraint means if i take

163
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:49,480
a node i in my graph they can be at most one
head for that ok so if i say that j is the

164
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,669
head for i so j is the head for i i cannot
find another k so the k is also head for i

165
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:00,620
this is not possible there will be only one
head for i node at most is called the single

166
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,149
head constraint
and then finally we have the fourth constraint

167
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:17,879
that is g is projective it says if from i
i can derive j and from j so i am using the

168
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:24,259
word derive here derive means from i ah i
is the head and i have the dependent j then

169
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:44,279
from j i have a dependent by some number of
edges k for any k such that j k lie on the

170
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:58,279
same side of i ok and this is the projectivity
constraint and what do we mean by that if

171
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,450
i were edge from i to j and from j i can have
in any number of steps i going to k then j

172
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:13,830
and k should lie on the same side of i so
that is

173
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:23,440
if i am saying this is my i and from here
i have this relation to node j ok let me just

174
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:33,570
project them i is here and j is here ok then
what i am saying is that if j connects to

175
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:42,009
any dependent either directly or indirectly
that k has to be on the right hand side only

176
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:46,440
so there are two possibilities suppose i am
taking direct connection i can connect to

177
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:55,880
k this is allowed or i can connect to a k
here ok so this denote the linear order in

178
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,759
the way they are occurring in the sentence
so i and j are here so k can occur either

179
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:10,240
here or here ok or anywhere else in the right
but what is not allowed is if j is related

180
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:22,559
to some k here that is not allowed because
now j and k are on the different side of i

181
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,620
ok so where whatever side j is k also should
be on the same side and if so if this situation

182
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:40,749
happens this is called non projectivity also
there is another term for that it is called

183
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:54,120
crossing of dependency edges so you are seeing
here this line and this line are crossing

184
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,799
here if i am if i am taking this particular
constraint while they do not cross if i take

185
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,710
this constraint or this constraint and you
can see if you can go any number of steps

186
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,889
they will not cross ok and this particular
constraint is called the projectivity constraint

187
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:18,800
now what is important is that this constraint
of projectivity is a many times dependent

188
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,330
on the particular language that you are choosing
for your dependency construction so it might

189
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,129
happen that there are certain languages that
do not follow this projectivity constraint

190
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:32,389
and some languages like english they very
they quite regularly follow this projectivity

191
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:45,910
constraint so this is like language dependent
so the methods that the the dependency parsing

192
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:51,500
methods that we will study in this week so
we will study one method that that needs projectivity

193
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,940
constraint another method that does not need
this constraint ok

194
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,620
so but yeah these four constraints are very
very important so that you can come up with

195
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:07,639
the good algorithm for a dependency parsing
of the sentence so yeah this is an example

196
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:13,510
of what is projectivity so if i have a link
from a to b i cannot have a link from b to

197
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,840
c because c is on the other side of a similarly
if i have a link from a to b i cannot have

198
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:27,159
a link from b to c ok because they are crossing
in general what do they mean these four conditions

199
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,600
so connectedness means that the syntactic
structure obtaining my dependency graph is

200
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,039
complete i am not having any isolated nodes
that are not connected to my whole structure

201
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,389
so in condition of acyclicity means that the
structure is hierarchical there is no cycles

202
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:49,210
inside
what is the single head constraint it says

203
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:54,980
that every word has at most one syntactic
head it cannot have more than one syntactic

204
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,509
head so or in other words we are saying it
is determined only by one word not by multiple

205
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:07,409
words right remember we were saying that ah
the linear position of a dependent sometimes

206
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:12,800
depends on the head so node one two different
heads to decide the position of the single

207
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,330
word and then they might be conflicts the
same word has only one head that determines

208
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,419
it's syntactic category and and in other things
ah there is no crossing of dependencies that

209
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,259
is the last constraint of projectivity that
we also saw

210
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:36,279
so now once we have these four constraints
what is my dependency parsing so this is how

211
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:42,502
i can define the dependency parsing i am given
a sentence x that contains words w one to

212
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:50,789
w n and i want to obtained a output as dependency
graph given this input of sequence of words

213
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:55,350
in my sentence i want to obtain my dependency
graph that follows that constraint that we

214
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:03,110
saw earlier ok so it is like single head constraint
and ah projectivity if i am imposing that

215
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,520
and all that so i want to obtain dependency
graph

216
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,870
so what are different methods that that we
will be using for this so we will we will

217
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,480
talk about different methods so like ah one
method will be deterministic parsing this

218
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,450
is a very very popular method then a method
based on maximum spanning tree and finally

219
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,340
you can also do it in a constraint propagation
method so in this course we will talk about

220
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,990
the first two methods and how you can use
that by having some sort of labeled data and

221
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,760
doing some learning from there so it's like
a data driven parsing and the final method

222
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,590
is something that you will use when if node
have any labeled data but you know what are

223
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,190
some of the constraints that your grammars
follows so can you can you encode those constraints

224
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:55,159
inside your dependency grammar and obtain
dependency graph for a given sentence so this

225
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,760
is good for the languages where if node have
a labeled data but you have the labeled data

226
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,950
in terms of dependency ah graphs you probably
go for a data driven approach so starting

227
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,330
from the next lesson we will start talking
about this data driven approaches for dependency

228
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,029
parsing
thank you
