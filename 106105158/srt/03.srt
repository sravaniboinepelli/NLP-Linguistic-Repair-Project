00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,609
hello everyone so welcome to the third lecture
of the first week so in the last lecture we

2
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,099
were discussing what do we do in n l p what
are the various applications where n l p has

3
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,030
been used ok and in which been use currently
in what are some of the ferric some of the

4
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,800
future potentials of n l p so today in this
lecture we will discuss why is n l p hard

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,719
what are the some of the difficult is that
we face while the joining algorithms for n

6
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,899
l p and and why do we need to worry about
various machine learning techniques and all

7
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,239
an n l p ok

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,960
so which is start with a very simple case
of of the kind of problems that you face in

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,510
n l p so we start with the case of lexical
ambiguities ok ambiguities as you understand

10
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:09,530
is ah implied for the same word meaning various
interpretations ok

11
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,380
so take take this example sentence have so
have this sentence will will will wills will

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,690
so what you see here is the same word will
has been used five times so let us try to

13
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,979
to find out what are the various interpretations
of meaning the same what will has been used

14
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:38,860
for will will will wills will so what what
do you say about the first will ok so the

15
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:52,051
first will is a modal verb like should would
can etcetera the second will here is an name

16
00:01:52,051 --> 00:02:00,680
of a person this sometimes easy to get from
the from the english sentence because the

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,989
full always been in capitals ok then you have
the third will so this is a verb in the sentence

18
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:15,590
ok to express his will the fourth one is again
a name of a person you can see by the apostrophe

19
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,840
that is after this word but it can be either
the same will or a different will ok so against

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,790
a name of person but we denote is the same
will or a different will

21
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,760
but by the way we the way we write language
in the way we communicating language we can

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,980
say this probably is a second person because
if it by the same person i would have used

23
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:45,909
probably hinge ok and this will is a noun
the will itself ok so what you are saying

24
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:55,670
in the same sentence will the person will
will express or use wills will we are using

25
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,989
the same word will at least four in four different
meanings so this is one of the extreme cases

26
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:07,660
that we seen language ok but let us try to
go through some other examples so this is

27
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:15,010
another example rose rose to put rose roes
on her rows of roses ok so so here can we

28
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,129
try to decide for what are the various meanings
that i am flight for the same word rose

29
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:31,049
so what you say about the first rose the first
rose is the name of the person ok rose they

30
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:45,560
should be a verb in the percent past tense
to put rose rose ok so what is that this will

31
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:54,599
be an adjective and rose is some sort of the
seafood ok and then we have the the next sentence

32
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:06,230
on her rose of roses and these versus you
can find out these are the flowers and this

33
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:14,590
is arrow with you so again this see here the
same word rose if you see the way it is written

34
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:22,860
so in terms of autography the same word rose
has been use one now as a name as a verb as

35
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,440
an adjective and as a flower ok four different
sans age but but for the time just try to

36
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,110
think of some a speech recognition system
ok we are your trying to pronounce this sentence

37
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,639
and it has to transcript what what are the
different words that you have said in your

38
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:51,300
trends so it will have ambiguity even to find
out whether this rose means arrow e s or arrow

39
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,920
f s e ok this is another another problem that
this also handled by various models that we

40
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:05,110
will see in natural language processing ok
and let us take another extreme example ok

41
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,390
so the buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo
buffalo buffalo buffalo ok so now in this

42
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,630
sent this sentence is compares only by a single
word used to a to times so can you try to

43
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,500
decide for this ok so let me give your hint
here so here the what buffalo has been using

44
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:35,850
two sense three senses buffalo so one is the
city in u s another buffalo is an animal and

45
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:47,860
the third buffalo is like a verb that is used
in the same sense as bully ok so now given

46
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:58,819
these three interpretations so can you try
to decide for the meaning of the sentence

47
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:17,060
ok so let us try to identify various blocks
here buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo

48
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:29,780
buffalo buffalo buffalo ok so let me try to
give you what are the units together ok

49
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,740
so there are three units in this sentence
ok so now what would be the interpretation

50
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:49,449
so these are the cities ok so these are the
cities by c and the animal a a and a and these

51
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:57,389
two are verbs ok so then this would be the
interpretation of the sentence buffaloes from

52
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:04,639
buffalo new york whom buffaloes from buffalo
new york bully bully buffaloes from buffalo

53
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,790
new york ok probably is not the sentence that
you will encountered very often in the in

54
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:15,300
the copes but this is has to convey the point
that that in language you can you can actually

55
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,490
use the same word and multiple different meanings
and that creates a problem and this problem

56
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,419
is called as lexical ambi ambiguity the same
word in lexicon is used in multiple different

57
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:31,990
senses ok
so now let us go to the next problem or again

58
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,979
get to ambiguities that is a structural ambiguity
ok what do i mean by structural ambiguity

59
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,710
so i can have different interpretations of
the same sent sentence ok so let us see the

60
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:48,590
first sentence here so this is very very common
example that we given n l p the men saw the

61
00:07:48,590 --> 00:08:05,849
boy with the binoculars ok so can you try
to see what is the ambiguity here so the ambiguity

62
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:17,000
here is whether the binoculars are with the
boy or the binoculars are with man whether

63
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,100
the men saw the boy with this binoculars or
whether the men saw the who was standing with

64
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,430
these binoculars so these are two different
interpretations of the same sentence

65
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,659
let us see the other sentence here flying
planes can be dangerous can you see the two

66
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,830
interpretations of the sentence so what is
dangerous are the planes dangerous or flying

67
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:51,280
dangerous you see flying planes can be dangerous
ok so whether the flying is dangerous or flying

68
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,780
planes together is dangerous so these are
the two interpretations of the same sentence

69
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,179
similarly you can see the third sentence here
whole found in the room wall police are looking

70
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:09,130
in to it ok so now can you see the ambiguity
in the sentence so ambiguity here is what

71
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,610
appeal police look looking in to or the looking
into the whole or the looking in to the matter

72
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,530
that there was a whole and we are looking
in to the matter ok

73
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,720
so this is another problem that we that we
face very very often would language that this

74
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,470
is ambiguous both in terms of lexical ambiguity
the same word can imply multiple meanings

75
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,650
or a structural ambiguity where the same sentence
can be interpreted in multiple ways ok and

76
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,790
then we have some other problems like languages
very imprecise and vague so what are the examples

77
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:46,260
here so so here is simple sentence it is very
warm here so can you see what is the weightiness

78
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:56,970
or imprecision here so whenever i see a word
like its very warm here i cannot tell for

79
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,910
sure what would be the temperature where ok
is if i am an india for me warm many a temperature

80
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,870
of only forty degrees celsius but if i am
in u k europe for me warm might been twenty

81
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,510
five degree celsius ok
and it might also depend on what was the weather

82
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,180
in the last month and so so this depends on
a lot of context you find out what is the

83
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:23,210
actual temperature that is been conveyed by
this simple sentence similarly if you see

84
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:29,670
the other other example ok so have a question
did you did your mother called your aunt last

85
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,480
night and the answer is i am sure she must
have so what is the imprecision and vagueness

86
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,559
here in the sentence so you see whenever i
say i am sure she would have done that that

87
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:47,250
means i do not know ok if i if i know that
i will say yes she she has called but whenever

88
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,329
i am see i am show she must have so probably
i do not know whether she had ok but yeah

89
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:59,480
thats what i say this is the fun part of n
l p with the that helps in consisting a lot

90
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,260
of jokes ok
so i have the symbol so this is a nice joke

91
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,270
for the class is so why is the teacher wearing
sun glasses and you can given answer because

92
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,429
the class is so bright and you can see the
bright might mean either the class is bright

93
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:19,370
in the sense of lot of sun light and on or
because the class is very bright in the sense

94
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:28,579
of the students being really intangible ok
fine so continuing on the same topic of ambiguities

95
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:34,410
so let us see some other examples so that
that is something that we see will news headlines

96
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,920
so which is the first sentence hospitals assued
by seven foot doctors so can we see the ambiguity

97
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,020
here in general when you when you look at
this sentence what comes to your mind probably

98
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:51,940
the doctors as seven foot ok
seven foot doctors ok of course we will a

99
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,680
seven feet doctors but yes this might you
want to a interpretation but what is implied

100
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:05,690
by the sentence there are seven different
doctors ok and they are all four doctors so

101
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,420
that is what is implied seven different foot
doctors take the next sentence here in stolen

102
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,800
painting found by tree so can you see the
ambiguity so it looks as if the tree found

103
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,680
the paintings ok but at but what it means
is that the paintings for found any other

104
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:35,230
tree ok take the third example teachers teacher
a strikes 

105
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:42,260
idle kids so when you see the sentence as
it is what comes your mind teacher strikes

106
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:50,570
some kids ok but what the headline where meaning
teacher is striking ok there is some semicolon

107
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:58,270
and the kids are idle ok
so lets take lets do an simple exercise on

108
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,920
the on the same topic of ambiguity so i can
give a simple sentence are made her doctor

109
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,290
now try to find so peoples so there are three
are ten or more than ten meanings for the

110
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:16,000
sentence but try to find at least five meanings
of this sentence i made her duck ok so thats

111
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:28,660
do this exercise i made her duck so whatever
different meanings this sentence can take

112
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,620
ok so we need to see what is the different
interpretations each of the word can have

113
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:43,380
in this sentence ok so for example the worth
made can mean for example cook or make ok

114
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:51,800
so one interpretation can be i could a duck
for her ok so simple interpretation i cooked

115
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:03,630
a duck for her ok that is one interpretation
now in the same sense of cooking i can also

116
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:10,530
try to write a different interpretation ok
what is that so one meaning is i made her

117
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:23,880
duck another could be i made a duck that belong
to her ok i cooked a duck belonging to her

118
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,150
so that is her duck it may not i might not
a cook for her i might a cook for myself but

119
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:37,790
i cooked that that belong to her i made her
duck now made can also mean mean is simp simple

120
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:51,699
making so you can think of an artificial duck
like a toy and i can say i made the artificial

121
00:14:51,699 --> 00:15:01,449
duck she owns ok of course we can also have
the second interpretation here i can i i made

122
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,460
the artificial duck for her or belonging to
her

123
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,000
but let us take this interpretation now what
are the other two interpretations you can

124
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,630
think of ok so now try to think of the other
meaning of duck kind of be use as a work ok

125
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,050
so if your listening to some cricket commentaries
sometimes so batsman duck whenever they bou

126
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:28,900
bouncer and sometimes ok so that means loading
once head so one interpretation can be i made

127
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:44,130
her lower her head that can be another interpretation
now can you think of any different interpretation

128
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:51,000
from all the for that we have see hint will
now so the hint is that try to going the herry

129
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,309
about a mode ok so this is something like
i waved my magic wand and converted her into

130
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:16,289
duck this thats a possibles would interpretation
i waved my magic wa wand that turned her into

131
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:21,620
a duck ok
so you see the simple sentence i made here

132
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:28,980
duck can have at least these five different
in depressions so so these of the five interpretations

133
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,410
that we saw so now what is in the language
that gives rise to all these different interpretations

134
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:42,679
ok so let us try to look closely ok so this
ambiguity is pervasive everywhere so how so

135
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:47,780
one thing is about the syntactic category
what is the role of a word in a sentence so

136
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:53,500
you see the word duck here it can mean either
a noun or a verb so can you label the sentences

137
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:02,150
here where duck has been uses a noun so this
is noun this is noun this is noun this is

138
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:09,130
verb this is noun ok so fine so these are
two interpretations duck can be noun or ever

139
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,870
ok
then there are there is a there is a case

140
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:22,260
with her the word her can either be a possessive
of her or dative for her so can you see the

141
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:30,550
the two examples here the two interpretations
which were made because of these so this was

142
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:41,810
dative i did it for her or this is possessive
belonging to her so these are again two interpretations

143
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:51,430
for for this this ambiguity in language then
we so make can mean either to create or cook

144
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:59,300
this so this for cooking and this was also
making what is then if you go to grammar the

145
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,910
same work make can be either transitive that
means it will be a na it will be a verb with

146
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:10,780
a single noun as direct objective it can be
ditransitive that means a verb that is having

147
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,330
two different non objects or action transitive
it has a direct object plus a verb

148
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:22,860
so in these five interpretations can you try
to mark them where the verb make was uses

149
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:31,620
transitive ditransitive and action transitive
so here i have the same work make which is

150
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:41,680
having and object and a verb ok i made her
lower her head or i made her do something

151
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:52,890
ok so this is action transitive ok what is
ditransitive so where there are two objects

152
00:18:52,890 --> 00:19:02,610
of the same work so i cooked a duck for her
so this as two different objects and what

153
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,980
is the single transitive i could they duck
belonging to her this is a single object ok

154
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:15,980
so here there are two different objects so
this is ditransitive and this is transitive

155
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:24,810
so in language the same verb may can be use
any of these three different vague and that

156
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:31,350
gives me three different interpretations ok
so so now suppose you go to phonetics ok so

157
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,360
i am is speaking this sentence i made her
duck what are different interpretations you

158
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,070
can think of so i am so what happens in speak
a speech recognition i am a spin something

159
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,770
and you have to transcript ok so whenever
i see i made her duck you might thing of all

160
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:52,380
these possible transcriptions so like i am
eight or duck i am aid her duck all these

161
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,280
are possible ok but the problem that n l p
decisions will face is going there are many

162
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:05,720
different possible interpretations which going
to choose in a given context ok so let see

163
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,790
something from the ambiguity now so i have
the simple sentence i saw the men with the

164
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,810
telescope and we saw earlier it can have two
different parses so parses i mean different

165
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,520
ways in which the words can be connected in
this sentence

166
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,470
so we will have a complete topic on parses
is give we will discuss there in detail but

167
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,900
i guess you can see at least the the idea
from the last example so now suppose i try

168
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,650
to increase the length of the sentence i saw
the man on the hill with the telescope and

169
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:40,410
immediately you can find five different parses
of the scientist ok this is doesn't stop here

170
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,950
so let me have bit this sentence i saw the
man on the hill in texas with the telescope

171
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,920
ok so now it has fourteen parses if i say
i saw the man on the hill in texas with the

172
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,400
telescope at noon it has forty two parses
and if i say i saw the man on the hill in

173
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,500
texas with the telescope at noon on on monday
it look one thirty two parses ok and you can

174
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:11,090
actually the laid these numbers to something
call a catalan number ok

175
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,750
so as you keep on increasing the number of
in the sentence the number of interpretations

176
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:24,430
in which they can be connected in the sentence
increase ok so now so why is language ambiguous

177
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,820
ok this can be a nice question that why is
language ambiguous at all so we need to understand

178
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,490
what is the goal of language as such so language
is used for communication ok so the goal in

179
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:44,870
in prediction or communication languages to
to be able to communicate ideas ah clearly

180
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:53,310
ok but at the same time i should there are
certain certain restrictions or that then

181
00:21:53,310 --> 00:22:00,340
that that a post like i should have shorter
linguistic expressions ok so think of the

182
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,390
previous example that we saw in the last slide
the same sentence was having one thirty two

183
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,750
different interpretations
now what if i if if i need to have a different

184
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,630
sentence for each of this one to thirty two
a different interpretations that will make

185
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:21,190
by language expression really large and also
the language will become very complex so what

186
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:27,080
happens in language some sort of ambiguities
allowed but is ambiguity is some that is easily

187
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,630
resolvable ok so you cannot have an ambiguity
there is not resolvable at all so by some

188
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:38,810
sort of knowledge that you have human being
ah tries to resolve it ok but in in in the

189
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,410
case of n l p we try to we have we have this
starts for developing algorithm that kind

190
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:51,400
resolve this ambiguity ok so yes language
relies mostly on the peoples ability to use

191
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:58,960
their knowledge and some inference capabilities
to properly to resolve these ambiguities ok

192
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,080
so now so just a brief discussion on what
is the difference between a natural language

193
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,900
and a computer language as such so one of
one primary difference is the is is the ambiguity

194
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,360
ok in programming language is do not have
any ambiguity in so whenever you write a program

195
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,740
with will mean only one particular thing these
no ambiguity their but that is not the same

196
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:25,010
there is not true for the case of language
in natural language ok so so all the programming

197
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,650
languages are formal and they are designed
to be unambiguous so that you can have very

198
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:35,170
very efficient passing for that ok so they
can always you defined by a grammar that process

199
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:42,370
a unique parse for each sentence or each programming
construct in in the language ok that is not

200
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:50,050
true for the natural languages
so so you can have parsing in ne ne linear

201
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:59,470
time ok now why else is n l p hard ok so this
carton gives you some idea that i do not understand

202
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,420
the a word young people say these days ok
so so that so i am talking about social media

203
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:20,309
here so see you i will text you later ok the
the sentence see you i will text you later

204
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:33,900
now your writing is c u i will text u you
later ok so now now the the problematic hand

205
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,980
is to understand that that you have actually
meaning the sentence and find out a starting

206
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:47,670
from c u mean this c from you the you mean
this u and so on ok so so this is also called

207
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,440
the non standard use of english and that is
very very problem with the use of social media

208
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:00,980
all the s m s and other other plate forms
ok so let us see this particular tweet ok

209
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:07,540
so great job justin bieber we are so proud
of what you have accomplished you taught us

210
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:13,740
to never say never and you yourself should
never give up either ok so in this sentence

211
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:20,510
sees a tweet ok so what are the things that
you do not see in formal language so one example

212
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:25,440
here is mention the use of mention at justin
bieber so this mention is again wherever is

213
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,400
specific to tweet a and your using hash text
never say never is a single harsh text ok

214
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:40,720
what is so we are seeing constructs like this
you have is take is written as you have you

215
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:51,540
v e and to is remains two so this is again
non use of english that makes n l p difficult

216
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,680
ok then there are many other problems like
segmentation issue so i have the simple sentence

217
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:03,220
the new york new heaven railroad so based
by segment this particular sentence

218
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:17,930
especially new york new haven should i segmented
like that new york new haven or new york new

219
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:26,740
haven the second is the correct segmentation
ok so there are two possible segmentation

220
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:35,400
of the same sentence so problem would another
would be to find out what is the correct segmentation

221
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,820
given this sentence then there are other cases
like the case of idioms in in language ok

222
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,870
so so what happens in the case of idioms you
cannot construct the the meaning of the page

223
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,450
by looking at the meaning of the individual
words and trying compose them together so

224
00:26:53,450 --> 00:27:01,550
if i see a idiom like dork horse i cannot
take the meaning of a horse which is dork

225
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:08,940
and make the meaning of this idiom dork house
is something else is a so this is some sort

226
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,120
of idiom that is conveyed for the person who
is not well known but he suddenly becomes

227
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,110
a dork a dork horse
so the he is suddenly excelling in in certain

228
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:24,430
field ok similarly you see this idiom ball
in your court ok doesn't mean the ball is

229
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:30,210
in your court that means the matrix at your
hand and now its similarly this idiom again

230
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,760
is again very much used burn the midnight
oil there is not mean that i am burning the

231
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:43,000
oil that midnight but what it means is that
your doing hard work ok then there are various

232
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,561
ah new words that have that have been floated
a new usages that are coming up ok so they

233
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:52,620
also called new logiest so for a one a particular
example so these are examples are taken from

234
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:59,520
social media is un friending ok i have some
face book friend and i am un friending ok

235
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:07,570
so this has become is is is a verb itself
retweet ok re tweet has been used a lot as

236
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,700
a work similar googles skype photoshop all
are very much used in as for i am googling

237
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,480
ok and all
so that creates another problem for n l p

238
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,820
that is new words are coming up and different
and and new a new usages to you do not have

239
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:30,790
a close vocabulary and vocabulary and your
vocabulary keeps on increasing then you you

240
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:36,160
you keep on getting new senses of the words
ok so this see this particular example thats

241
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,060
segued ok so n pointing here to the word sick
so what is the usual meaning of sick that

242
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,890
you see sick i will something that is not
hell the that is some one who is hill but

243
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:57,110
in this particular sentence thats sick dude
sick mean sick means something that is cool

244
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:03,800
and that we coming up with social media ok
similarly you see the word giants what is

245
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,100
the particular meaning of giants seasonally
we see giants as some sort of demons that

246
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,590
that we have in in storage
but recently some some new meaning of giants

247
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:19,550
is coming up so that you can think of like
some sort of giant multi nationals and all

248
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:29,460
that ok giant manufactures and then there
is a problem of entity names ok so take this

249
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,100
sentence where is a bugs life playing you
cannot understand the meaning of the sentence

250
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,820
un less you know that this particular utterance
a bugs life is single entity and then you

251
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,450
try to understand the meaning of the sentence
similarly the second sentence let it be was

252
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:53,860
recorded you need to understand that let it
be is single entity here ok so what we do

253
00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:00,170
in n l p to handle all that so we need to
have some knowledge the language how the sentence

254
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,320
is a constructed what kind of words are their
and so on

255
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,330
we need to knowledge about the world ok and
many to have the way in which begin combined

256
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:16,370
various knowledge resources in an efficient
manner ok so how is it generally done so most

257
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,360
of the times we do it by using various probabilistic
models ok so this is the single simple example

258
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,200
here so i have word like image on in french
and may translated in english and there are

259
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,570
multiple interpretations so i want to use
a model that page the probability that image

260
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:37,740
on goes to house is high and i should choose
this particular interpretation ok similarly

261
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,300
for the next sentence suppose this is for
this speech recognition system whenever i

262
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:50,510
am saying saying i so a wend and they are
two interpretations i saw a wend or eyes ah

263
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:55,560
of n i should be able to say that the first
interpretation is more probable to occur in

264
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:02,270
the language then the second temptation ok
and and we will deal deal with this a lot

265
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:10,470
so many a times we have to extract lot of
text features that does most of this job ok

266
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:17,100
so fine so in this lecture we covered some
aspects of wild languages hard so in the next

267
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,060
lecture we will start talking about some of
the very very basic empirical large that we

268
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,870
see in language and we will start with doing
some basic pre processing ok
