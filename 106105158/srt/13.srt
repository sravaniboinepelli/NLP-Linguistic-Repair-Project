1
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,980
so hello everyone so welcome back for the
second module of third week so in the last

2
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,910
week we had so in the last week in the last
module we were discussing about language modeling

3
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,230
that is how we can effectively use the word
ordering information for where is applications

4
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,140
we will go to the next topic we will talk
about the morphology information that what

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,900
are the different modules that help us captures
information [an/and] what are different linguistic

6
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,820
terms that are involved so today we will start
with the linguistic terms and then we will

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:59,020
and with what the are possible modules that
can help us capture this in a in an automatic

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,830
panel so what is so we are talking about computation
morphology today so what is morphology in

9
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:12,050
morphology we study what is internal structure
of words so that is given a particular word

10
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,830
in a language what are the [dif/different]
meaningful units it is made up off and each

11
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,170
small unit is called a morphemes so let us
take some examples so if i take the word dogs

12
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,520
so it is made up of two different units one
is dog the actual root word and another is

13
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,390
affix that is applied to the word to make
it a plural that is ok so there are two morphemes

14
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,920
in this single word dogs similarly if i take
a word like un lady like so we are having

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,110
three different units here so these are three
different morphemes so un that corresponds

16
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:51,310
to not irrigation or opposition then lady
well behave women like that is having the

17
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,090
characteristic of so there are three different
morphemes that together constitute this single

18
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,430
word (Refer Time:02:00)
so now we will also see what are the various

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,140
linguistic notions that that you might be
my want to be aware of and we are talking

20
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,239
about morphology so for example what are allomorphs
so is given a word like happy if you are converting

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,230
to it is opposites we are making ah a word
like unhappy but if i take ah another word

22
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,919
like rational i will i will use i r so i will
make irrational so if they are different morphemes

23
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:34,030
that can be use for the same purpose they
are called allomorphs ok so here is an example

24
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,040
so so allomorphs we are saying variants of
the same morphemes but in general we cannot

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,109
replace by one another so so let us see here
so if i have the word happy i can use u n

26
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:51,269
to make it unhappy comprehensible i can use
i n incomprehensible if a possible i can use

27
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,600
i m impossible and rational i will say irrational
ok but you can see that we cannot replace

28
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,571
i r by u n here so i cannot say unrational
that is not a valid english word so there

29
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:08,209
are various ah reasoning for why a particular
morpheme is used one of these is could be

30
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,080
because of the phonemes that are they are
in the in the particular word so irrational

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,250
we have the irrational with happy we have
unhappy so that is the for different words

32
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,600
we have different sort of morphemes that you
apply to make opposites so that is for one

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,010
particular function but for different functions
like and and ah person and all that you again

34
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,470
have various person and all that you again
have various ah category morphemes that are

35
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,230
applied
so again when we talk about morphemes there

36
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,150
is a distinction called bound morphemes verses
free morphemes so what are those so bound

37
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,560
morphemes are those morphemes that cannot
appear as a word by itself ok so for example

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,169
take the previous example unhappy so i cannot
take the morpheme un here use it as a as a

39
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,340
unique single word itself so this is bound
by another word that is applied with this

40
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,030
say unhappy so it is it is bound with happy
or some other words with this you can be use

41
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,040
it on the other hand if i take the word happy
it is [free/free morphemes] it can used on

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,009
it is soon ok that is how we divide the morphemes
into these two categories bound verses free

43
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:23,500
so here are some examples so bound morphemes
are like s so it can be used for making plural

44
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:33,150
so with dog we have dogs l y so quick to quickly
and e d walk to walked so these are all bound

45
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,500
morphemes and then there are free morphemes
when they can appear as a word by themselves

46
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,220
ok and they can also combine with other morphemes
if needed so for example if i take the morphemes

47
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,030
like house it can appeared as a word by itself
but can also be combine with other morphemes

48
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,500
like s to make plural houses similarly walk
it can combine with e d to make a plu[ral]-

49
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,260
make a past tens of walked and so on some
words like of ah in etcetera they are also

50
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:10,220
free morphemes they can appear on their own
so then there is another distinction and this

51
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,660
is very very important when we talk about
morphology so in general when i talk about

52
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,260
a word it can have two main parts one is the
stem the main the root word and another is

53
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,510
the affix and it can have more than one of
affixes as well so what are stem and affixes

54
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:36,100
ok so when we talk about a word so ah a stem
is the core meaning bearing part ok so i take

55
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,250
i take a word like boys so the the the stem
here will be boy so that is the meaning can

56
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,850
bearing part and then there are various ah
bits and pieces that can be apply to it that

57
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,980
that can ultra certain grammatical functions
so i can have i can apply and as at the end

58
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:01,130
of to make a plural of this so these are called
affixes so in general you can make a correspondence

59
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,850
between ah stems and affixes and bound and
free morphemes so you can say that the stems

60
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:13,040
are kind of free morphemes and the affixes
are kind of bound morphemes so this kind of

61
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,240
correspondence you can you can make
so now what are the different types of affixes

62
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,020
that you can apply with the given stem so
this we just discuss about one simple example

63
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,290
of applying s so this s apply after the word
boy are make a plural with boys so this is

64
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,639
called suffix that is applied at the end of
the word but in general what are the different

65
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:43,730
types of affixes that can be applied so so
we start with prefixes so prefixes are applied

66
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:52,400
before the word so some example in english
are un so we make unhappy anti antinational

67
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,560
pre preexisting and so on we have these prefixes
in other languages also for example in hindi

68
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,610
and sanskrit we have (Refer Time: 07: 00)
the prefixes like ah [FL] that we can apply

69
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,750
with various words or verbs so these are of
prefixes

70
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,931
then we have suffixes that are applied after
the word so like with the word talk i can

71
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:18,400
make a new word talking by applying the suffix
by i n g similarly the word quick i can make

72
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,389
a new word quickly by applying the suffix
l l y at the end ok and in in the case of

73
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:32,050
hindi for example you can have this exercise
like tha and k a ka etcetera that can apply

74
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:40,419
after the words
then so the prefix and suffix are the major

75
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:48,190
major su[sufix]- major suffixes affixes that
we have in language but certain language have

76
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,070
some other kind of exercise also so one is
called infix that is it is applied in between

77
00:07:54,070 --> 00:08:00,120
that stem not before or after that so ah so
example is like in sanskrith we have the word

78
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,199
with to know and we make the present tense
by putting vindati so the word the the character

79
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,950
n the phonin n is applied in between between
v and the so you becom becomes vindati so

80
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,330
there are examples in other languages also
like in the case of philippines here basa

81
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:27,740
b a s a is read and to make it the to converted
to the past tense read the infix u m is applied

82
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,700
in between so we have b u m a s a so u m is
applied in between is called infix now so

83
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,770
can we think of an infix in the case of english
english it is not common in in common language

84
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,290
it is not infix is not used but in general
can we make a word in english that that uses

85
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:56,020
infix so so here an example is if i take the
word absolutely and put a word bloody inside

86
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,250
so you can have a word like [ab/absolute]
bloodilutely so this is to put some emphasis

87
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,750
that is not used in common english (Refer
Time:09:00) but in ah certain movie dialogues

88
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,930
and all you can find such kind of words
finally so what can what you think can be

89
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,500
the fourth category we have prefix suffix
infix what is the meaning is that a suffix

90
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,339
an affix comes before as well as after so
this is called circumfix ok so this proceeds

91
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,310
as well as follows the same word so an example
in dutch so you have a word for mountain b

92
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:33,330
e r g and to to converted to plural we have
an affix that is applied before g e as well

93
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,202
as after so the the whole affix is g e t e
half of that is applied before and half of

94
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:43,730
that is applied after so this is called circumfix
so among this four kind of affixes the first

95
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,960
two are very very common prefix and suffix
and the last two are expressive to certain

96
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:57,230
languages only
now morphemes can also be divided into some

97
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,850
other categories like content verses (Refer
Time:10:00) functional morphemes so what are

98
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,880
content morphemes that are those that will
that will be a semantic meaning ok so for

99
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,800
example if even if i take any free morphemes
like car a word it is always a content morphemes

100
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,910
it contents some semantic meaning similarly
i can take a morpheme bound morpheme like

101
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,339
able also that is a semantic meaning that
given a word it it it keeps a sense of being

102
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:32,100
able to do something so on the other hand
there are certain morphemes that are functional

103
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,310
that do not take the semantic content they
are only used for certain grammatical functions

104
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,970
like as for plural as for third singular they
are both functional morphemes you apply it

105
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,290
after a word and it has a particular grammatical
meaning but it may not be a syman[tic]- it

106
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:57,860
may not contain a semantic meaning as such
now so based on whatever kind of affixes that

107
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,820
you that you apply to a word (Refer Time:11:00)
you will generate a new word ok so for example

108
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:19,250
if i if i have a word walk and i apply a suffix
i n g i get a new word like walking ok so

109
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:26,490
there is a process that converts a word walk
to walking ok so by putting certain morphology

110
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:37,920
here now take another example i take a verb
like drive and i i add some affix and make

111
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:48,890
a new word like driver so now what is the
differences that you see in the two processes

112
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:55,400
ok so we can call it may be e r drive plus
e r that gives you driver so from drive we

113
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,021
can creating driver verses from walk you are
creating walking so what is the difference

114
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:04,240
that you see in the two processes (Refer Time:12:0)
so if you think about it in the first case

115
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,980
we not changing the grammatical category of
the word as such ok so this is a verb walk

116
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,380
it remains the verb here also walking but
we add some grammatical information as a continuous

117
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:22,800
text on the continuance other hand here you
start with the verb drive and we end up making

118
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,941
a noun you covert the category of of the verb
itself by this process of morphology so there

119
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:39,220
are two different kind of morphological processes
so this is called inflectional morphology

120
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:47,029
and this is called derivational morphology
ok so so in this slide we are seeing the difference

121
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:52,620
between between these so so they they they
give you the relation between two words that

122
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,959
you have you have created first case you have
created from walk to walking so what is the

123
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,830
relation between these two words second case
you created drive to driver what is the relation

124
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:06,750
between these two words (Refer Time:13:00)
so in flectional morphology if makes changes

125
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,750
in the terms of numbers tens case and gender
ok so for example if you start with the word

126
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:19,360
verb bring you can alter the case you can
have brought you can have third person singular

127
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,580
brings and so on so they do not ah change
the ah category of this word so but you add

128
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,170
some more grammatical information that is
all so this is called inflectional morphology

129
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,450
you are adding certain inflectional information
only in the grammatical sense that is not

130
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,790
change in the category of the word on the
other hand you have derivational morphology

131
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,870
where you create some new words and you also
change the change the category of the word

132
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,089
so this is called part of speech that we will
take up in the same week in in the in the

133
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:55,450
fourth module so it changes the category of
the word so for example from logic you can

134
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,370
make logical and illogical logicality logician
and all that and there you can you can see

135
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,570
(Refer Time:14:00) the do not have the same
category all these words they have they are

136
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:10,680
different categories one is noun adverb and
and so on adjective

137
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,770
in general derivational morphology is also
fairly systematic like inflectional morphology

138
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:22,220
but sometimes certain derivations will be
missing ok so for example here is here is

139
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:30,500
some nice examples so if i take the word sincere
i can make sincerity scarce scarcity curious

140
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,980
curiosity but from fierce you should not use
like fiercity ok although it is very very

141
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,350
if it looks very very regular if you starts
seen from the previous words so they are pretty

142
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,000
regular but some words do not have the corresponding
derivational words

143
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,430
now so we are talked about whatever the various
kind of morphemes ok and what are the process

144
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:58,620
what are the different types of affixes that
you can apply but in general what are the

145
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,720
various morphological process that are involved
(Refer Time:15:00) to convert one word into

146
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,410
another word ok so so we will talk about this
so for so one simple process is called concatenation

147
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,649
so we will take various morphemes and concatenate
together to make a new new morpheme ok so

148
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:21,860
for example happy un you make unhappy simple
concatenation similarly here hope and less

149
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,290
together make hopeless and un happy make unhappy
and anti capital i s t and s these four morphemes

150
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:35,330
if you concatenate together and then make
a single word or singular morpheme

151
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:43,529
so now then we are combining the different
morphemes together at the boundary or when

152
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:50,870
they are combined there may be certain changes
ok the changes can be in in the way the final

153
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,660
word is pronounced or in the way the final
word is writen so there is two are called

154
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:01,260
fundamic changes and graphemic changes graphemic
in the terms how the word is written (Refer

155
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,861
Time:16:00) and phenomic in the way word is
pronounced so here some examples so if i take

156
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:14,579
a word book and if morpheme book and a morpheme
s if i combined together i get books so s

157
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:21,220
see the pronunciation if i take shoe and s
i get shoes so here it is not s it is za it

158
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,910
is a different phonyms that terms so there
are certain changes that happen at the boundary

159
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,829
in terms of how the word is pronounced similarly
if i take word like happy and e r these change

160
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:39,850
at the graphic graphemiclable so where in
the grapheme y changes to i so this is also

161
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:47,470
called simply spelling change at the at the
morpheme boundary so this can happen there

162
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,660
are some morphological processes also like
reduplication so then we adding in a suffix

163
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,810
you might do reduplication somewhere in the
stem

164
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:06,929
so example is (Refer Time:17:00) like in number
language if i take a word go or look if i

165
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:13,480
want to say examine with attention i will
say i will just repeat the go go similarly

166
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,870
in tagalog you have basa for read and if i
want to say will read i will i will read duplicate

167
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:28,299
ba ba ba sa so you reduplicating one part
ok in sanskrit again this is very common phenomena

168
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:35,759
or reduplication i take the word like much
that is to cook and if i if i want to converted

169
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:42,749
it to the perfect form cooked i will reduplicate
the pa and i say papaca so you see the word

170
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:49,529
pa is reduplicated they can be reduplication
also ah in in certain languages also ok example

171
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:54,710
in telugu so certain phrase is repeated again
so for example i want to say the child fell

172
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:03,720
down while walking so here i say [FL] so here
[FL] is being repeated twice for saying while

173
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:14,679
walking ok there are other morphological like
suppletion where a word is completely ah replaced

174
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:21,179
by something that has no connection at the
ah surface lavel so i have a word like go

175
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,409
and i am converting into the past tense and
it becomes went so you cannot find any connection

176
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:30,460
go and went and this are surface label this
is simple supplition similarly with good i

177
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:38,039
can make better ok and there are many examples
in english for this sometimes there some internal

178
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:44,340
changes in the morpheme so from from sing
you want convert the plural you will so from

179
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:52,900
sing you can get sang and sung for different
ten tenses and from men to converted to plural

180
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:00,679
and you get m e n ok and from goose you get
geese for converting to plural so you see

181
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:11,789
there are there are changes there are in internally
in in the word you not adding any new suffix

182
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:16,200
then while we are talking about word formation
they another process called compounding so

183
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,440
that is i can take two different words and
make a compound out of that ok and this compounding

184
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,960
can be from various part of speech for example
in english i can two take two adjectives so

185
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,239
bitter and sweet i can make adject single
compound bitter sweet i can take two nouns

186
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:40,710
rain and bow i can make a noun rainbow i can
take a noun and verb pick and pocket and this

187
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:51,220
becomes a verb pickpocket ok similarly over
do what is interesting is that these compounds

188
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,519
are very very particular to languages ok
so let us take an example like room temperature

189
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,830
that is a that is a compound in english but
is there a corresponding compound in hindi

190
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:08,110
so you you never say [FL] as a single compound
you will say [FL] so that means so finding

191
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,799
this compound is in interesting problem for
going to application like machine translation

192
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:19,860
so where you you cannot just directly convert
the words into the equivalent ah ah target

193
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,090
languages so you cannot say room with combined
temperature with [FL] you need to find out

194
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,249
with there is a compound there is relation
between the two words and according to the

195
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:35,100
translation 
then there is another process that is called

196
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:43,009
acronyms ok for example the word laser is
an acronyms then there is blending ok

197
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:48,049
so your take so this is again a very common
process linguistic so were you take two words

198
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:53,140
and then you combine together blend them together
to make a new word but the you are taking

199
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,909
from both the words but you not taking the
full words so example is breakfast and lunch

200
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:01,759
you can take together and make a new word
like brunch ok similarly smoke and fog you

201
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:09,720
make a new word a smog motor motor and hotel
make a word like a motel ok and there is a

202
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:18,019
process of clipping ok so that used a lot
for example i have doctor doctor becomes doc

203
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:23,850
laboratory becomes lab and advertising because
becomes add dormitory becomes dom and examination

204
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:29,580
becomes exam bicycle becomes bike and refrigerator
becomes fridge so this is clipping so long

205
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,220
words are shortened
so now so this is all the different processes

206
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,342
that happens in happen in morphology now so
from the n l p prospective so we will talk

207
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:47,840
about how do we process of morphology so what
do a what does it and until what processing

208
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,639
of morphology so what are different things
that that are done so one simple thing is

209
00:21:53,639 --> 00:22:01,169
lemmatization that is given a word can identify
what is the root word what is the lemma ok

210
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:06,210
an example is is if a give me a word like
saw can i tell what is the root word is it

211
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,351
a if it is a verb the root word what will
be see ah but if it is a noun the root word

212
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:19,299
will be saw itself so you can find a what
is the root word silly it is lemma there is

213
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:24,109
there is a morphological analysis also so
that is even a word can i find out what is

214
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:31,919
the corresponding lemma along with morphological
category of that word ok so it is particular

215
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,700
tag so example is i take a verb word like
saw can i tell the the lemma is see and this

216
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:45,249
a past tense of that verb or saw is the lemma
and it is a noun singular noun so this is

217
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:52,419
morphological analysis of the given word
then there is a process called tagging so

218
00:22:52,419 --> 00:23:01,609
where i find out what is the actual ah so
what is the actual category of this word so

219
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:06,879
the difference here is from the morphology
analysis that i also have to disambiguate

220
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:12,460
so morphological analysis you saw i was giving
two different possibilities in tagging i have

221
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,210
to further find out what is the actual correct
grammatical category here so i have a sentence

222
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:24,070
is peter saw her i know the word saw can be
either a noun or verb and we also so their

223
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:31,080
lemmas but can i say can i tell in this particular
context the word saw will only be a verb and

224
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,320
not a noun so can i do the actual disambiguation
also this is that is how tagging is different

225
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,070
from the morphological analysis and then we
have a morphological segmentation where given

226
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:48,769
a word i can segment to with different morpheme
that involved so i have a word like denationalization

227
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:55,830
i said de nation a l i z ation they are different
morphemes that are in this word so in general

228
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:01,340
among all these processes so part of speech
tagging is very very popular so will words

229
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,820
sometime for that and before that we will
quickly see what is ah morphological analysis

230
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:14,010
lemmatization how it is done
ok and finally there is also these process

231
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:20,269
of generalization where i can take a word
a root word and a particular grammatical category

232
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:25,700
and i have to generate a a a new word from
this so see ah and i want to generate past

233
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,509
tense i want to find out saw ok in n l p it
is not very popular unless you are talking

234
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:39,440
about national language generation where you
might want to use this ok so ya before going

235
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,259
into the process what might be the application
for doing this why should we be interested

236
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:50,409
in doing morphological analysis for example
text to speech synthesis ok so what is text

237
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:56,429
to speech synthesis you have seen something
that is written and you have to find produce

238
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:01,109
the corresponding is speech speech for that
so now if you have a word like lead written

239
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:07,769
somewhere now depending on whether it is a
noun or a verb you will have a different pronunciation

240
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:13,989
for that ok lead verses led depending on noun
or a verb so it is important of find out from

241
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:22,559
the text whether it is a noun or verb ok same
thing goes with read ok read verses red in

242
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,769
general it is very important for other things
likes search and information retrieval ok

243
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:34,179
so might want to use the a morphological category
to reduce the certain space ok and also machine

244
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:40,669
translation we saw some example and especially
because if you know the morphological category

245
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:45,789
you can find out the for the target languages
what is corresponding affix is or different

246
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:51,190
words that is being used in that languages
and grammatical error correction and and all

247
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,159
that so if you if you know what is the morphological
category of this word in the whatever is written

248
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,200
if you can find out this is not the correct
morphology that is use you can try to correct

249
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:11,529
it
so now what is morphological analysis so this

250
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:19,129
is have seen earlier so as i input we have
words like cats cat citizen so on and as an

251
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:25,549
output i want to find out given a word like
cats what is the root verb here cat what is

252
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:30,789
category noun and it is a plural cat plus
n plus p l something like that so in this

253
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:36,599
table so if i am a given input in the left
as per the left column i want a output like

254
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:44,479
the right column ok so so the output that
i will generate will contain additional information

255
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:50,520
like this i0073 noun this is singular for
s g for singular p l for plural and v for

256
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,940
verb like that so this is all the information
that i want to get from the from the given

257
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:02,659
word now what might be the issues involved
while doing morphological analysis one particular

258
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:09,220
problem is that it is not very very regular
for example from the word boy i can get plural

259
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:16,830
boys but what happens if i taken input like
fly i get flies f l i e s ok so this you see

260
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:23,700
that they are following two different sort
of tools for doing changes at the bounding

261
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,720
similarly if i take the word like toiling
i can get toil but what happens if i give

262
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,399
an input like duckling should i used same
sort of full to get duckl that is not correct

263
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,159
of english word ok so how do i know the duckling
is not a correct english word when an input

264
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:47,239
like a duckling is provides to my system similarly
from getter i get g e t plus e r from doer

265
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:54,590
d o plus e r but what happens if given input
like beer do i output like b e plus e r so

266
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,609
these are some of the issues that involved
in processing morphology now if i have to

267
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:02,989
solve these issues what is what are the different
knowledge that i need to have

268
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:09,969
so so i need to have some knowledge on what
are the different words or fruits in english

269
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:15,570
ok so for example i need to know that duck
is a possible root but duckl is not a possible

270
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,909
root in english so we need some sort of dictionary
or lexicon of english what are different nouns

271
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:28,639
and verbs etcetera in english what else i
need to have some knowledge of morpho techniques

272
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:34,269
what is morpho techniques that is which kind
of morphemes follow other kind of morphemes

273
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:40,870
for example if i have to convert a noun to
plural i know plural morphems always follow

274
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:50,869
the noun so this is the morphotactics information
which morpheme follows are the morphemes then

275
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:54,639
i also need to have this information that
some endings go only on certain words not

276
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:58,489
on everything
so on d o i can apply e r to get doer but

277
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:05,389
on b e on the verb b e i cannot apply e r
to get a word like beer so this is again these

278
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:12,210
constraints also i need to have and then i
need to some worry about spell spelling change

279
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,229
rules so then whenever i have word like get
i apply e r it converts to getter so there

280
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:25,490
is just duplication on of duplication of the
ending t

281
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,789
so now so one question you might have is that
ok why cant i put everything together in a

282
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:36,559
big lexicon so that is all the root words
all their morphological variants why cannot

283
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,309
they already put in a big lexicon and there
i can search even new word i can search in

284
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:46,099
the lexicon find out what is the actual word
and its category if they are finite by country

285
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:53,190
do that so there are two different reasons
why this may not be very good solution so

286
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:58,669
one is if you take any language like english
it is very easy so where for a given but they

287
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:05,440
are not many variations in terms of morphology
so ah so this is some strategies from a data

288
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,330
set that in english there are roughly you
take ninety thousand lexical entries and you

289
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,669
will find out all the possible morphological
forms that you can generate then you find

290
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:19,960
a ratio of three point five two one that is
from word you can generate roughly three point

291
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,889
five more very to variants including that
word in english but this is not true for other

292
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:32,289
languages for example the same thing if you
do for sanskrit you have a lexicon of one

293
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,840
seventy thousand entries but if you try to
derive the forms so the ratio that you come

294
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,370
up with is something like sixty four point
seven is to one ok so the eleven million forms

295
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,289
that are generate so these are huge in number
ok so sixty four is a very big ratio in comparison

296
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:53,259
to three points five but again this may for
now it may not be a very big number again

297
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:58,539
ok you can still argue that this might this
will it be put in a big lexicon and and you

298
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:04,840
can search over that but there is another
problem ok that is you can keep on coining

299
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,729
new words and apply the same morphological
processes to generate its forms and you do

300
00:31:09,729 --> 00:31:14,679
not know these words a prior so you cannot
store their morphological variants in the

301
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,009
lexicon so on the other hand if you can store
the what kind of rules in valued for mailing

302
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:26,839
from a word to its plural given a new plural
form you can try to find out its original

303
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,609
root word ok
so that is why we will be studying what kind

304
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:38,109
of methods are possibly used and the one of
the most popular method in this field of computation

305
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:44,851
morphology finally state methods ok so this
was very very popular earlier first the language

306
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:50,070
like english also and and later on for other
languages like indian languages another european

307
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:56,200
language so even now if you talk about processing
the morphology methods are one of the most

308
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,739
popular choices so fine so in this lecture
we talked about composition morphology what

309
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:07,881
are the linguistics terminologies and and
what is the process as such what is the n

310
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:13,390
l p perspective there and in the next lecture
we will talk about how do i use final state

311
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,210
methods for this processing ok
thank you
