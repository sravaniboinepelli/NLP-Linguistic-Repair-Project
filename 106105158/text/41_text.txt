 so hello everyone so ah so welcome to this final lecture of week eight and so in this week we have talked about our a different method of semantics that is lexical semantics and we saw that how we can use connection between words to find out semantics and last two lectures we we talked about a very classical problem of word senses disambiguation that is even a word if it has multiple senses how do you find out ah in a given context what particular sense has been used and this is a very generic kind of problem and you can use a lot of different methods for solving that and we saw that how you can use simple knowledge base approaches by using the dictionary definitions and you can use some machine learning methods you can use some bootstrapping based methods and also unsupervised methods there we also talked about a page rank based algorithm if you want to jointly find out the senses for each words you did not describe that algorithm fully so if you want to know in in that algorithm details so you might have to wait till we cover the summarization topic in summarization i will talk about pagerank in detail but i sense the generic idea you can also get from the what we discussed and also you can look it up so now so this lecture we are taking a new research problem that is coming from word sense disambiguation idea itself and also from whatever we discussed in the towards the end of in the last lecture so in the towards the end of the last lecture we were talking about ah learning the word senses in an unsupervised manner that is now i am not talking about senses defined in a dictionary so i am saying ok i have a corpus i know how the word has been used multiple times can i use the the usage of the word to find out what are it's senses and what was the basic idea so basic idea was that if i know that i have a corpus see my corpus and i can find out which words co occurred other words ok so like that i can construct some some what model i know what what's co occur what and all words so idea was it suppose i am constructing this network if a word has two senses what will happen the words that correspond to it's so there is suppose my center word so words that i connect corresponding to one sense will be connected together words that are in second sense will be connected together this is sense one this is sense two so if i am building the whole co occurrence graph if i center it around the particular word and try to cluster it i can find out it's different senses it is a very generic idea and this i call as word sense induction also also known as from wsi there are many ways of doing that because they are many ways you can do this clustering you can apply any graph based clustering method so for example chinese whispers is a very popular algorithm and you can use any other methods also so idea would be now when you do that for each word you will get some senses s one s two s three and so on and these might correspond to say the words these are the words it can be different words we can have weights and so on now so this is you have give a corpus you can find out what are the word senses but in this lecture we will talking about the problem that can you find out if a word has got a new sense or not in some recent time had you got a new sense now does that happen so over the time we keep on using the same words new new and senses ok so and with the social media that is becoming a lot more common that you are using the same word in some new senses that is that it was never used before so let's see one example so i have the word sick right sick is a very common and popular word and you will say ok what is the meaning of sick something to be related to some disease illness ok so like so this is the pub dictionary definition so affected with a disease or illness of or relating to people who are ill and very annoyed or bored by something because you have had too much of it so i am sick of that so now this is one common sense of sick now do you think sick has got any new sense in recent times and and and if you think about it sick has got a very a new sense and that is completely opposite of this particular sense so what is that sense so let us look at this tweet so listening to paulo nutinis new record it's sick ok so now what is the meaning of sick here of the same word sick it's not boring ok so this thick means something that is very very cool ok so this sick has got a very new meaning from whatever we were seeing earlier something that disease illness to something that is very cool now so what's keep on getting these new meanings in the in the ah in the corpus so the way people are using that now the problem is suppose my dictionary or my lexicon like word net is not getting updated regularly so if this word sick has got this new sense and it is being used in this new sense in the corpus i will never be able to match it to any of the sense in the word net because word net has not recorded the sense at all so does not know probably sick has the sense also and this is happening for many other words ok so now what is done in this field of novel word sense detection from the corpus and the way the words are being used can i detect whether the word has got new sense and if i can detect it i can populate different lexicons and different and also my word net version i can update using this definitions so how do we find out the word has got new sense now again so this is a new area but there have been some different sort of methods and works i will not go into details of any of those works but what i will do i will try to give you a basic idea that if you understand watson induction how can you use that to find out new word sense or novel word sense so let us so have a basic idea the basic idea is that i can try to compare the sense so that is if your word is undergoing sense change it can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods ok so something like this so you take the word compiler suppose in nineteen not nine nineteen fifty three so the we take took the data and we did the watsons induction and from the induction we found out that the word compiler has these two senses so one sense is in the sense of reporter auditor listener etcetera second is on scientists compositor philosopher publisher preacher so there are two different senses this so what it means is that these words come together to form one sense and these words come together to form another senses in nineteen not nine nineteen fifty three compiler was merely some sort of person who wish to compile now if i look at this word in recent time like two thousand two thousand five compiler has got the sense in the sense of ah programming language compilers this sense was not available not there in nineteen not nine nineteen fifty three so can i automatically detect that the word has got a new sense from the data itself so what i will do again into v into two thousand five i will do the watsons induction so suppose i do induction and i find these two senses so one is again the same sense translator editor listener reader commentator that is similar to what we had earlier but you see a new sense also coming up preprocessor driver handler hardware software loader kernel dbms ok and you can immediately see by looking at these words in the computer sense this sense was not available earlier so now this is interesting observation that if i simply do watson sense induction over the new time period i find a sense cluster that was not available before and this gives me a generic framework so what i will do i will take my data that is over several time so it can be say eighteen hundred to two thousand ten or whatever so it's starting from some t one to t two i want to find out what words have undergone sense change so what i will do i will try to take some slice of this data call it time point t one take another slice later on time point t two is that ok so now i will do i will compute my co occurrence ah and whatever i want to compute my distributional casares then i will do watsons induction so for each word i will find out s one in time t one s two in time t one s three in time t one and so on and that i will do for all the words similarly i will do the same thing at time t two so i am at w and i will say s one at time t two s two at time t two s three at time t two and so on ok now i have got the sense cluster at time t one and at time t two now i will try to compare these to find out if the word has got a new sense cluster that was not available in the previous time point and the second do for all the words and by doing that i can find out which words have got a new sense of the newer time period so and in general i can define various ah various different sort of sense change for example it might happen that earlier a word as a sense it has got to split into multiple senses or it can be a join two different senses of joined together to form the same sense they may not be so common but what is common is something like a birth that the word had initially two senses s one and s two now in the new time period it has got a new sense s n this is very very common and then they might be death of a sense also that earlier it had a sense of s zero now in the new time period i cannot sense find out the sense so all these you can find out just by comparing these sense clusters so here is another example that we observed from the data so this is from the work that we did ah in two thousand fourteen so this was in a c l two thousand fourteen if you want to have a look so the title was that's sick dude ok and there was some other subtitle so this was in year two thousand fourteen so so we did so we took the data from google anagrams and we took the whole data from starting from ah somewhere around sixteen hundred to two thousand eight divided into eight different time points then ah so that they were divided such that in each time point you have roughly the same amount of data so as you go over ah recent years even like three years and four years for making a complete time duration in earlier it might be hundred years together because the data was not too much and then we took different time points constructed distribution of and then you ah chinese algorithm to find out sense clusters and then complain the clusters and so what are the words that are getting some new sense so here was an one example so we found that the word registers earlier had these senses and you can see these are like dictionaries directories libraries compilations bulletins these are registers as you like paper registers and so on so that you have even now similarly here notebook diary returns accounts so in the new time period we form that these two senses are there directories compilations manuals summaries schedules ledgers notebook but a very new senses come up and can you think of the sense what is the sense peripherals processor circuits workstations devices so register has got the sense of if the sense of computing in a hardware that so now ah so this new sense we could detect simply by using the corpus that these all words are being used with resistance and and they were having similar ah co occurrence such as the word to resistance so we found this is a new sense cluster that is coming up and like then many other senses so this is i will say as i was saying this is a new research field and some works have have come up in this in this field this is one such work but i hope the basic ideas care that if you want to detect new word sense what you need to do so that ends this week of lexical semantics so next week again we will continue with the topic of semantics so we have started with distributions of semantics one idea then we talked about lexical semantics another idea of semantics now we will see how we can capture semantics using topics ok can we find out what are the topics that are there in my data use that for some semantics and that's why we will discuss topic models detail ok and there are again very very popular tools in n l p so thank you i will see you in the next week
