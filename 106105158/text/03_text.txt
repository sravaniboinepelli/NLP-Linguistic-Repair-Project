 hello everyone so welcome to the third lecture of the first week so in the last lecture we were discussing what do we do in n l p what are the various applications where n l p has been used ok and in which been use currently in what are some of the ferric some of the future potentials of n l p so today in this lecture we will discuss why is n l p hard what are the some of the difficult is that we face while the joining algorithms for n l p and and why do we need to worry about various machine learning techniques and all an n l p ok so which is start with a very simple case of of the kind of problems that you face in n l p so we start with the case of lexical ambiguities ok ambiguities as you understand is ah implied for the same word meaning various interpretations ok so take take this example sentence have so have this sentence will will will wills will so what you see here is the same word will has been used five times so let us try to to find out what are the various interpretations of meaning the same what will has been used for will will will wills will so what what do you say about the first will ok so the first will is a modal verb like should would can etcetera the second will here is an name of a person this sometimes easy to get from the from the english sentence because the full always been in capitals ok then you have the third will so this is a verb in the sentence ok to express his will the fourth one is again a name of a person you can see by the apostrophe that is after this word but it can be either the same will or a different will ok so against a name of person but we denote is the same will or a different will but by the way we the way we write language in the way we communicating language we can say this probably is a second person because if it by the same person i would have used probably hinge ok and this will is a noun the will itself ok so what you are saying in the same sentence will the person will will express or use wills will we are using the same word will at least four in four different meanings so this is one of the extreme cases that we seen language ok but let us try to go through some other examples so this is another example rose rose to put rose roes on her rows of roses ok so so here can we try to decide for what are the various meanings that i am flight for the same word rose so what you say about the first rose the first rose is the name of the person ok rose they should be a verb in the percent past tense to put rose rose ok so what is that this will be an adjective and rose is some sort of the seafood ok and then we have the the next sentence on her rose of roses and these versus you can find out these are the flowers and this is arrow with you so again this see here the same word rose if you see the way it is written so in terms of autography the same word rose has been use one now as a name as a verb as an adjective and as a flower ok four different sans age but but for the time just try to think of some a speech recognition system ok we are your trying to pronounce this sentence and it has to transcript what what are the different words that you have said in your trends so it will have ambiguity even to find out whether this rose means arrow e s or arrow f s e ok this is another another problem that this also handled by various models that we will see in natural language processing ok and let us take another extreme example ok so the buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo ok so now in this sent this sentence is compares only by a single word used to a to times so can you try to decide for this ok so let me give your hint here so here the what buffalo has been using two sense three senses buffalo so one is the city in u s another buffalo is an animal and the third buffalo is like a verb that is used in the same sense as bully ok so now given these three interpretations so can you try to decide for the meaning of the sentence ok so let us try to identify various blocks here buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo ok so let me try to give you what are the units together ok so there are three units in this sentence ok so now what would be the interpretation so these are the cities ok so these are the cities by c and the animal a a and a and these two are verbs ok so then this would be the interpretation of the sentence buffaloes from buffalo new york whom buffaloes from buffalo new york bully bully buffaloes from buffalo new york ok probably is not the sentence that you will encountered very often in the in the copes but this is has to convey the point that that in language you can you can actually use the same word and multiple different meanings and that creates a problem and this problem is called as lexical ambi ambiguity the same word in lexicon is used in multiple different senses ok so now let us go to the next problem or again get to ambiguities that is a structural ambiguity ok what do i mean by structural ambiguity so i can have different interpretations of the same sent sentence ok so let us see the first sentence here so this is very very common example that we given n l p the men saw the boy with the binoculars ok so can you try to see what is the ambiguity here so the ambiguity here is whether the binoculars are with the boy or the binoculars are with man whether the men saw the boy with this binoculars or whether the men saw the who was standing with these binoculars so these are two different interpretations of the same sentence let us see the other sentence here flying planes can be dangerous can you see the two interpretations of the sentence so what is dangerous are the planes dangerous or flying dangerous you see flying planes can be dangerous ok so whether the flying is dangerous or flying planes together is dangerous so these are the two interpretations of the same sentence similarly you can see the third sentence here whole found in the room wall police are looking in to it ok so now can you see the ambiguity in the sentence so ambiguity here is what appeal police look looking in to or the looking into the whole or the looking in to the matter that there was a whole and we are looking in to the matter ok so this is another problem that we that we face very very often would language that this is ambiguous both in terms of lexical ambiguity the same word can imply multiple meanings or a structural ambiguity where the same sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways ok and then we have some other problems like languages very imprecise and vague so what are the examples here so so here is simple sentence it is very warm here so can you see what is the weightiness or imprecision here so whenever i see a word like its very warm here i cannot tell for sure what would be the temperature where ok is if i am an india for me warm many a temperature of only forty degrees celsius but if i am in u k europe for me warm might been twenty five degree celsius ok and it might also depend on what was the weather in the last month and so so this depends on a lot of context you find out what is the actual temperature that is been conveyed by this simple sentence similarly if you see the other other example ok so have a question did you did your mother called your aunt last night and the answer is i am sure she must have so what is the imprecision and vagueness here in the sentence so you see whenever i say i am sure she would have done that that means i do not know ok if i if i know that i will say yes she she has called but whenever i am see i am show she must have so probably i do not know whether she had ok but yeah thats what i say this is the fun part of n l p with the that helps in consisting a lot of jokes ok so i have the symbol so this is a nice joke for the class is so why is the teacher wearing sun glasses and you can given answer because the class is so bright and you can see the bright might mean either the class is bright in the sense of lot of sun light and on or because the class is very bright in the sense of the students being really intangible ok fine so continuing on the same topic of ambiguities so let us see some other examples so that that is something that we see will news headlines so which is the first sentence hospitals assued by seven foot doctors so can we see the ambiguity here in general when you when you look at this sentence what comes to your mind probably the doctors as seven foot ok seven foot doctors ok of course we will a seven feet doctors but yes this might you want to a interpretation but what is implied by the sentence there are seven different doctors ok and they are all four doctors so that is what is implied seven different foot doctors take the next sentence here in stolen painting found by tree so can you see the ambiguity so it looks as if the tree found the paintings ok but at but what it means is that the paintings for found any other tree ok take the third example teachers teacher a strikes idle kids so when you see the sentence as it is what comes your mind teacher strikes some kids ok but what the headline where meaning teacher is striking ok there is some semicolon and the kids are idle ok so lets take lets do an simple exercise on the on the same topic of ambiguity so i can give a simple sentence are made her doctor now try to find so peoples so there are three are ten or more than ten meanings for the sentence but try to find at least five meanings of this sentence i made her duck ok so thats do this exercise i made her duck so whatever different meanings this sentence can take ok so we need to see what is the different interpretations each of the word can have in this sentence ok so for example the worth made can mean for example cook or make ok so one interpretation can be i could a duck for her ok so simple interpretation i cooked a duck for her ok that is one interpretation now in the same sense of cooking i can also try to write a different interpretation ok what is that so one meaning is i made her duck another could be i made a duck that belong to her ok i cooked a duck belonging to her so that is her duck it may not i might not a cook for her i might a cook for myself but i cooked that that belong to her i made her duck now made can also mean mean is simp simple making so you can think of an artificial duck like a toy and i can say i made the artificial duck she owns ok of course we can also have the second interpretation here i can i i made the artificial duck for her or belonging to her but let us take this interpretation now what are the other two interpretations you can think of ok so now try to think of the other meaning of duck kind of be use as a work ok so if your listening to some cricket commentaries sometimes so batsman duck whenever they bou bouncer and sometimes ok so that means loading once head so one interpretation can be i made her lower her head that can be another interpretation now can you think of any different interpretation from all the for that we have see hint will now so the hint is that try to going the herry about a mode ok so this is something like i waved my magic wand and converted her into duck this thats a possibles would interpretation i waved my magic wa wand that turned her into a duck ok so you see the simple sentence i made here duck can have at least these five different in depressions so so these of the five interpretations that we saw so now what is in the language that gives rise to all these different interpretations ok so let us try to look closely ok so this ambiguity is pervasive everywhere so how so one thing is about the syntactic category what is the role of a word in a sentence so you see the word duck here it can mean either a noun or a verb so can you label the sentences here where duck has been uses a noun so this is noun this is noun this is noun this is verb this is noun ok so fine so these are two interpretations duck can be noun or ever ok then there are there is a there is a case with her the word her can either be a possessive of her or dative for her so can you see the the two examples here the two interpretations which were made because of these so this was dative i did it for her or this is possessive belonging to her so these are again two interpretations for for this this ambiguity in language then we so make can mean either to create or cook this so this for cooking and this was also making what is then if you go to grammar the same work make can be either transitive that means it will be a na it will be a verb with a single noun as direct objective it can be ditransitive that means a verb that is having two different non objects or action transitive it has a direct object plus a verb so in these five interpretations can you try to mark them where the verb make was uses transitive ditransitive and action transitive so here i have the same work make which is having and object and a verb ok i made her lower her head or i made her do something ok so this is action transitive ok what is ditransitive so where there are two objects of the same work so i cooked a duck for her so this as two different objects and what is the single transitive i could they duck belonging to her this is a single object ok so here there are two different objects so this is ditransitive and this is transitive so in language the same verb may can be use any of these three different vague and that gives me three different interpretations ok so so now suppose you go to phonetics ok so i am is speaking this sentence i made her duck what are different interpretations you can think of so i am so what happens in speak a speech recognition i am a spin something and you have to transcript ok so whenever i see i made her duck you might thing of all these possible transcriptions so like i am eight or duck i am aid her duck all these are possible ok but the problem that n l p decisions will face is going there are many different possible interpretations which going to choose in a given context ok so let see something from the ambiguity now so i have the simple sentence i saw the men with the telescope and we saw earlier it can have two different parses so parses i mean different ways in which the words can be connected in this sentence so we will have a complete topic on parses is give we will discuss there in detail but i guess you can see at least the the idea from the last example so now suppose i try to increase the length of the sentence i saw the man on the hill with the telescope and immediately you can find five different parses of the scientist ok this is doesn't stop here so let me have bit this sentence i saw the man on the hill in texas with the telescope ok so now it has fourteen parses if i say i saw the man on the hill in texas with the telescope at noon it has forty two parses and if i say i saw the man on the hill in texas with the telescope at noon on on monday it look one thirty two parses ok and you can actually the laid these numbers to something call a catalan number ok so as you keep on increasing the number of in the sentence the number of interpretations in which they can be connected in the sentence increase ok so now so why is language ambiguous ok this can be a nice question that why is language ambiguous at all so we need to understand what is the goal of language as such so language is used for communication ok so the goal in in prediction or communication languages to to be able to communicate ideas ah clearly ok but at the same time i should there are certain certain restrictions or that then that that a post like i should have shorter linguistic expressions ok so think of the previous example that we saw in the last slide the same sentence was having one thirty two different interpretations now what if i if if i need to have a different sentence for each of this one to thirty two a different interpretations that will make by language expression really large and also the language will become very complex so what happens in language some sort of ambiguities allowed but is ambiguity is some that is easily resolvable ok so you cannot have an ambiguity there is not resolvable at all so by some sort of knowledge that you have human being ah tries to resolve it ok but in in in the case of n l p we try to we have we have this starts for developing algorithm that kind resolve this ambiguity ok so yes language relies mostly on the peoples ability to use their knowledge and some inference capabilities to properly to resolve these ambiguities ok so now so just a brief discussion on what is the difference between a natural language and a computer language as such so one of one primary difference is the is is the ambiguity ok in programming language is do not have any ambiguity in so whenever you write a program with will mean only one particular thing these no ambiguity their but that is not the same there is not true for the case of language in natural language ok so so all the programming languages are formal and they are designed to be unambiguous so that you can have very very efficient passing for that ok so they can always you defined by a grammar that process a unique parse for each sentence or each programming construct in in the language ok that is not true for the natural languages so so you can have parsing in ne ne linear time ok now why else is n l p hard ok so this carton gives you some idea that i do not understand the a word young people say these days ok so so that so i am talking about social media here so see you i will text you later ok the the sentence see you i will text you later now your writing is c u i will text u you later ok so now now the the problematic hand is to understand that that you have actually meaning the sentence and find out a starting from c u mean this c from you the you mean this u and so on ok so so this is also called the non standard use of english and that is very very problem with the use of social media all the s m s and other other plate forms ok so let us see this particular tweet ok so great job justin bieber we are so proud of what you have accomplished you taught us to never say never and you yourself should never give up either ok so in this sentence sees a tweet ok so what are the things that you do not see in formal language so one example here is mention the use of mention at justin bieber so this mention is again wherever is specific to tweet a and your using hash text never say never is a single harsh text ok what is so we are seeing constructs like this you have is take is written as you have you v e and to is remains two so this is again non use of english that makes n l p difficult ok then there are many other problems like segmentation issue so i have the simple sentence the new york new heaven railroad so based by segment this particular sentence especially new york new haven should i segmented like that new york new haven or new york new haven the second is the correct segmentation ok so there are two possible segmentation of the same sentence so problem would another would be to find out what is the correct segmentation given this sentence then there are other cases like the case of idioms in in language ok so so what happens in the case of idioms you cannot construct the the meaning of the page by looking at the meaning of the individual words and trying compose them together so if i see a idiom like dork horse i cannot take the meaning of a horse which is dork and make the meaning of this idiom dork house is something else is a so this is some sort of idiom that is conveyed for the person who is not well known but he suddenly becomes a dork a dork horse so the he is suddenly excelling in in certain field ok similarly you see this idiom ball in your court ok doesn't mean the ball is in your court that means the matrix at your hand and now its similarly this idiom again is again very much used burn the midnight oil there is not mean that i am burning the oil that midnight but what it means is that your doing hard work ok then there are various ah new words that have that have been floated a new usages that are coming up ok so they also called new logiest so for a one a particular example so these are examples are taken from social media is un friending ok i have some face book friend and i am un friending ok so this has become is is is a verb itself retweet ok re tweet has been used a lot as a work similar googles skype photoshop all are very much used in as for i am googling ok and all so that creates another problem for n l p that is new words are coming up and different and and new a new usages to you do not have a close vocabulary and vocabulary and your vocabulary keeps on increasing then you you you keep on getting new senses of the words ok so this see this particular example thats segued ok so n pointing here to the word sick so what is the usual meaning of sick that you see sick i will something that is not hell the that is some one who is hill but in this particular sentence thats sick dude sick mean sick means something that is cool and that we coming up with social media ok similarly you see the word giants what is the particular meaning of giants seasonally we see giants as some sort of demons that that we have in in storage but recently some some new meaning of giants is coming up so that you can think of like some sort of giant multi nationals and all that ok giant manufactures and then there is a problem of entity names ok so take this sentence where is a bugs life playing you cannot understand the meaning of the sentence un less you know that this particular utterance a bugs life is single entity and then you try to understand the meaning of the sentence similarly the second sentence let it be was recorded you need to understand that let it be is single entity here ok so what we do in n l p to handle all that so we need to have some knowledge the language how the sentence is a constructed what kind of words are their and so on we need to knowledge about the world ok and many to have the way in which begin combined various knowledge resources in an efficient manner ok so how is it generally done so most of the times we do it by using various probabilistic models ok so this is the single simple example here so i have word like image on in french and may translated in english and there are multiple interpretations so i want to use a model that page the probability that image on goes to house is high and i should choose this particular interpretation ok similarly for the next sentence suppose this is for this speech recognition system whenever i am saying saying i so a wend and they are two interpretations i saw a wend or eyes ah of n i should be able to say that the first interpretation is more probable to occur in the language then the second temptation ok and and we will deal deal with this a lot so many a times we have to extract lot of text features that does most of this job ok so fine so in this lecture we covered some aspects of wild languages hard so in the next lecture we will start talking about some of the very very basic empirical large that we see in language and we will start with doing some basic pre processing ok
