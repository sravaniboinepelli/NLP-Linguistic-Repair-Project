 so welcome to the fifth week of this course so we have so in this week we are going we will be moving up the hierarchy of ah solving this language processing tasks ok so we had started with discussing about how do we handle individual words how do we use how do we make use of the word or information using language models and then how do we assign various grammatical categories a part of speech categories to the words ok that is why what we are doing till now now we will go to next level where we will try to see can we arrange these words in certain groups ok so this is this is what we study in this topic of syntax so how are the words being arranged together ok and what can be how we can automatically find out this arrangement given a new sentence this will be the topic of parsing that we will discuss in this week ok so what is syntax so in general syntax refers to the way the words are arranged together ok and also you will see what is the relationship between various words and the word groups that is what we will talk about in syntax so when we were talking about language models we had discussed what is the importance of modeling word order so which words occur after what are the words how we can make use of that in assigning probability for a sentence all finding out the next word in completion task or in spelling correction task ok similarly when we were talking about part of speech task we saw what are the grammatical categories part of speech categories so this defines in one sort of equivalence class for words that is all these words behave like they are verbs behave in some some equivalent manner ok similarly all these words are nouns they behaving in some equivalent manner similarly all these are adjectives so you are define some equivalent classes now in syntax we will find out some more complex notions like word is constituency what are different grammatical relations among the words what what groups or what words are group together in constituency ok and subcategorization etcetera also included in this in this topic ok and yeah just to make you understand what is this notion of syntax so you can relate to that if you see this particular meme so i hope you remember this particular character from a statics this syntax the only part of the language it is not but important is it is right so you can see the way words are arranged normally in the way we speak and how they arranged in this particular sentence ok that was the special characteristics of this character ok so now so what are we are going to study in syntax so let me give you a simple example so i have the sentence the man read this book ok so by syntax we are trying we are trying to find out what are the various groups of word ok that are coming together for example in part of speech text we found out that the word the as part of speech of determiner man as the part of speech of noun read as verb and so on ok now we are going one level up so now we are saying this is determiner this is noun this is kind of nominal but they both together make a phrase noun phrase so i am saying the man is a noun phrase similarly this book is also a noun phrase so the there are two noun phrases here the man and this book but when the verb read or any verb comes before the noun phrase it makes a verb phrase ok so all these three words act as a single unit of a verb phrase ok there is a no such unit for man and read right there is a unit for read this book and the man and then i go up saying that a noun phrase and verb phrase are making the sentence and this gives me complete hierarchy structure of how the words arranged in the sentence the sentence is nothing but a noun phrase and the verb phrase this noun phrase contains a determiner and noun verb phrase contains a verb and noun phrase which contains and so on so this is the complete hierarchy of the sentence that i come to know by this syntax tree and that is the what is the topic of this week how do we come up with such syntax tree for a for some sentences what is the particular formulation that we will use ok let me start by defining some basic notions like what is constituency so in the last example we saw that a group of words right they act they acting as some single unit and you can call them as phrases clauses etcetera so in part of speech we could have done this substitution test so i have this sentence the there is a fill in the blank one in the room ok and i can i can filling any adjective the green one the fat one and intelligent one sad one all that can be filled in so i can fill in any word that belongs to that particular part of speech category now here it will be a particular constituent it will be a particular group of words that can behave similarly ok like here so all these four things kermit the frog they december twenty sixth the reason he running for president all these are noun phrases ok and they can occur in a given context so now for substitution test you can substitute any of this these four noun phrases and yeah we will see an example where all these can come in the same in a very very similar context so how do we name these constituent phrases so last slide i was showing some noun phrases so why do we call them noun phrases or something else so usually the names are given based on the words that are heading these constituent what is the head and usually speaking you can find the head by the word that can substituted for the whole thing ok let me take the first example the man from amherst ok this is the this is the phrase they are four words now which of the four word do you think can substitute the whole thing now that can that can be used in the grammatical ah function of the of the complete unit and that will be man where the man from amherst the word man can be used to denote the grammatical function of the whole unit so the head here is a noun man so this will be called a noun phrase ok because the head man is a noun similarly extremely clever the head here is clever this is the adjective so this is called in adjective phrase down the river here head is down preposition so this will called in prepositional phrase killed the rabbit the head is killed the word killed which is a verb so this is called verb phrase so like that we are we defined what are the constituent by taking what is the head of that phrase now in general words can also act as phrases so a phrase need not have always multiple heads a single word can also be a phrase so let us take the simple example joe grew potatoes so joe itself it is a noun phrase ok potato also a noun phrase they are nouns but also a noun phrases in this case now compare the sentence with the man from amherst grew beautiful russet potatoes so what do you seeing so instead of joe i have substituted the man from amhrest a complete a four word unit that is again a noun phrase and beautiful russet potatoes instead of potatoes they are still noun phrases ok so what happen in the sentence joe appears in a place where you could a probably put a larger noun phrase now this gives a very nice idea about the structure of the sentence ok in this sentence i am having a noun phrase and a verb phrase verb phrase contains a verb and noun phrase and noun phrase you can you can either put a single word like joe or you can put multiple words like the man from amhrest similarly in that noun phrase you can put potatoes or it become noun phrase like beautiful russet potatoes so this gives me lots of idea about how words are grouped in arrange together now there is some evidence that questions actually exist in language yes they are two different evidences one is that this phrase is appear in very very similar environment so far i have talk about the four phrases that noun phrases that discussed in one of the various phrases like let we see this examples kermit the frog comes on stage note it they come to massachusetts every summer december twenty sixth comes after christmas the reason he is running for president comes out only now so all these four nouns phrases are coming in a very similar context of the word say comes yes but i cannot take any individual word from here and put that in the context so i cannot take the word the and say the comes our out or i cannot say is comes out and i cannot say for comes out in this sentence ok i can only say the reason he is running for president comes out only now ok not an individual word so this whole thing behaves as a single unit and they occur in similar context all the noun phrase occurring in similar context this is got evidence to constituency what is the other evidence so the evidence is that this whole phrase is together can locate many locations in the same center ok so for example if i take on december twenty six that is the prepositional phrase and i can put it in many different phrases in the sentence on december twenty six i would like to fly to florida i would like to fly on december twenty six to florida or i would like to fly to florida on december twenty six all three are valid sentences where this complete phrase on december twenty six has we put in multiple location but you cannot break this into two parts and put it in phrases ok so you cannot say on december i would like to fly twenty sixth to florida or on i would like to fly december twenty sixth to florida you cannot say that so this will as a single group it cannot be split of part ok so these are some evidence that constituency actually exists in the language now what is the formal tool by which we can model this constituency that is how words are arranged together which words come together which was do not come together ok and what groups make a sentence and what groups make a verb phrase what group make a noun phrase how can i model all that what is the formulation ok and if you have take any course on formal language in automated theory all theory computation you might already know that the formulate that we can use that in context free grammar ok this is the most common way of modeling constituency so in one of the earlier lectures we talked about the ah languages by using deterministic finite automata of finite automata ok so this is context for context free languages by using by the context free grammar now so i will not going in very very basics i will just talk briefly how do we use context free grammar i will also defined the notions for the context free grammar so in the case of context free grammar what you will have you will have some sort of production rules that is what we mostly interested in so what they do the production rules will try to express what are the way in which various symbols of the language of group together ok and that is our main interest in using context free grammar which symbols are being group together that i can use that i can find out using or i can express using the production rules in context free grammars so let us see one simple example so i want to model this language that is noun phrase can be composed to either a proper noun or a determiner followed by a nominal where a nominal can be more than one nouns that is something i want to express about language so how do i use the context free grammar so i will say noun phrases proper noun or determiner nominal ok the nominal is noun or many nouns so how i write in context free grammar i will say noun phrase is proper noun or determiner nominal and what is a nominal it is one noun or more than one noun so noun or noun by a nominal ok this is the regression here so i can allow as many numbers of nouns as i want by using this ok and that is my ah context free grammar for for denoting the symbol ok that is the idea i can express all these facts about language how words are groups together which groups come together by using this production rules so once we know that what is the ah formulation of context free grammar very briefly said so in context free grammar when we study when we talk about a quadruple ok so therefore four four important variable set of variables so firstly i have set of terminals we have the leaf notes in my tree whenever we see so they will always come at the end and whenever i get a terminal i cannot derive anything from there so i have set of terminals so we will see what in the case of language what do they mean then we have set of non terminals that help me to do the derivations ok these are the variable from which you can further derive in more now so what is different in the case of n l p what is some distinguish will make in the set of non terminals we will also distinguish the set p that are pre terminals ok so pre terminals are those non terminals that will always derive terminals so they will always give me leaf nodes ok and with the example that will be clear what are what are they in the case of language then i have start symbol from which i am starting my derivation ok so if i have to model the sentence i should be starting with s that is the sentence and then i have the rules and they always of form x going to gamma ok and x has to be a non terminal a single non terminal and gamma can be any sequence of terminals and non terminals and that is the constraint that we see in case of context free grammar ok so this is the quadruple and we also seeing a pre terminal that is that is the set of non terminals in the language what are terminals and pre terminals terminals in the language will mainly with the final words that i will see in the lexicon and pre terminals will be part of speech categories from the pre because from the pre terminals you can derive only terminals ok so let us see one example and then we can point out what are terminals pre terminals and non terminals so this is what we are modeling earlier ok what is the noun phrase determiner for the nominal or a proper noun and where a nominal is a noun or a set of nouns which i model using a noun followed by a nominal now are you see some terminals here so there are no words so there is no terminals so i cannot use that to derive a phrase or a sentence it can only give me a set of grammatical categories so i have to include some facts on the lexicon to make it a complete grammar ok so so for example i can includes some determiners some nouns and some proper nouns so here i am including a and the has to determiners and flight as a noun now here can you identify what are the terminal non terminals and pre terminals so terminals are the words in my lexicon so a the and flight are my terminals pre terminals are the grammatical categories or parse category that will always give me terminals can you see that determiner noun are only giving me terminals so these are my pre terminals and apart from that all the variables like n p nominal they are my non terminals so proper noun no example is given but proper noun is also a pre terminal ok it is part of speech category it will give you some words to the lexicon so these are my terminals non terminals and pre terminals so now once you have the c f g you can use that to generate various phrases or sentences in language so for example i here this is the c f g for non phrases so can i can i generate a flight the phrase a flight is in this context free grammar ok so i will have to start with n p and i have to generate a flight so what is the first derivation i will to do from n p i will take this rule determiner followed by a nominal yes now determiner will give me a now from nominal i cannot go to flight directly so for nominal i will have to first get a noun and from noun i will get a i get the word flight so n p gives me determine nominal nominal gives me noun determiner gives me a a a noun and a flight thats how it generate a sequence of words using this grammar and now you can do it for any sentence you can define a grammar for a sentence and generate a sentences from that ok so what we are seeing here so there is a context free grammar is generate a series of strings ok and this sequence of rule expansions so the sequence that ah that you are using starting from n p going to determiner nominal then determiner noun then a noun then a flight this is called the derivation of the string using this grammar and we use it is tree structure to represent this derivation ok remember one of the very first tree that we had shown as a motivation so we will try to come up with such trees using this derivations and when we will be call the past tense ok now what is the notion of grammaticality using context free grammars the idea is that you defined one grammar for your language ok you have to assume that this is the this is the only grammar so any tool that is not expressed in the in the grammar is not allowed in the language so now when you are given a new sentence if you can see that there is a way to generate this sentence using my grammar the sentence is grammatical as per my grammar if the sentence cannot be generated in the grammar this is not grammatical this is a simple notion or using this grammar whatever sentence i can generate is grammatical and whatever i cannot is not grammatical so it depends on the grammar that you have designed the context free grammar that you have designed so yes so whatever can be derived are grammatical and others are ungrammatical now c f gs are interesting because they can also model some very interesting phenomena in in language syntax like recursion ok so in language you make lot of big big sentences by ah doing recursion so for example a preposition phrase can be written as a preposition followed by a noun phrase ok and noun phrase can be written as a noun phrase followed by a preposition phrase so you see there is a recursion here yes so i can encode the noun phrase noun and prepositional phrase is here preposition phase can again encode a noun phrase which can encode a proportion phrase so this is the recursion is very very common in language ok so let's see one example so the set example is the mailman ate his and this is the complete noun phrase is starting from lunch till the end of the sentence lunch and noun phrase is a noun preposition phrase with and this is not shown here but this is again starts a noun phrase preposition phrase is a preposition followed by a noun phrase with his friend from the cleaning staff and all this is a noun phrase and what is this noun phrase noun ok his friend followed by a preposition phrase and so on the recursion is very nicely captured by using context free grammar ok now shall end this lecture by just saying what is the context denotes in context free grammar what is the meaning of context so language we talk about context as such ok so we say context is given a word find out what is the context what are the previous words and what is the ah topic and all that so these are all define the context but this context is nothing to do with what is context in the case of context free grammar this is very very formal notion ok so ah so this is nothing do with the ordinary meaning of word context in language so all this means is that in context free grammar whenever i am doing a derivation ok so whenever i am writing a gives the b c ok or say noun phrase give me determiner nominal whenever i am writing a rule like that it means is that the noun terminal left it all in its own by itself ok it does not need any context around it so i can always write a goes to b c irrespective of whatever is around my word a ok so even if i have x a earlier i can use a to derive x b c and if i have irrespective of what is x or any y i can always write like this and this x and y are immaterial they do not matter it can be null it can be whatever similarly if i inferring whenever i see a b c i can always infer a so this it might have come from a independent of the context of b c and this is what context free grammar so if you go would go the next label of context sensitive grammars there are you need the context this word a can derive b c in this particular left context in a particular right context we do not need this left and right context in the case of context free grammars ok this what the context the word context means in this case so so whenever i have a rule a goes b c it means that i can write a i can always write from a b followed by c regardless of the context in which a is found or whenever i find and b followed by a c i can infer a regardless of the context in which b and c is found so so this is c f g for for us ah i am not going to lot of basics of context free grammars and i suggest that you can quickly look at any of the chapters in the basic books of ah formal languages and automated theory so but whatever is required for our ah tasks of doing parsing i have covered in this lecture i will and i will cover the necessary things in the next lecture so in the next lecture what we will do we will start from c f gs and we will see how we can use that for actually doing the parsing for a given sentence in the in the language ok so we will take a various approaches for parsing ok so that will be the next topic for the next lecture thank you
