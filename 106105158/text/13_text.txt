 so hello everyone so welcome back for the second module of third week so in the last week we had so in the last week in the last module we were discussing about language modeling that is how we can effectively use the word ordering information for where is applications we will go to the next topic we will talk about the morphology information that what are the different modules that help us captures information [an/and] what are different linguistic terms that are involved so today we will start with the linguistic terms and then we will and with what the are possible modules that can help us capture this in a in an automatic panel so what is so we are talking about computation morphology today so what is morphology in morphology we study what is internal structure of words so that is given a particular word in a language what are the [dif/different] meaningful units it is made up off and each small unit is called a morphemes so let us take some examples so if i take the word dogs so it is made up of two different units one is dog the actual root word and another is affix that is applied to the word to make it a plural that is ok so there are two morphemes in this single word dogs similarly if i take a word like un lady like so we are having three different units here so these are three different morphemes so un that corresponds to not irrigation or opposition then lady well behave women like that is having the characteristic of so there are three different morphemes that together constitute this single word (Refer Time:02:00) so now we will also see what are the various linguistic notions that that you might be my want to be aware of and we are talking about morphology so for example what are allomorphs so is given a word like happy if you are converting to it is opposites we are making ah a word like unhappy but if i take ah another word like rational i will i will use i r so i will make irrational so if they are different morphemes that can be use for the same purpose they are called allomorphs ok so here is an example so so allomorphs we are saying variants of the same morphemes but in general we cannot replace by one another so so let us see here so if i have the word happy i can use u n to make it unhappy comprehensible i can use i n incomprehensible if a possible i can use i m impossible and rational i will say irrational ok but you can see that we cannot replace i r by u n here so i cannot say unrational that is not a valid english word so there are various ah reasoning for why a particular morpheme is used one of these is could be because of the phonemes that are they are in the in the particular word so irrational we have the irrational with happy we have unhappy so that is the for different words we have different sort of morphemes that you apply to make opposites so that is for one particular function but for different functions like and and ah person and all that you again have various person and all that you again have various ah category morphemes that are applied so again when we talk about morphemes there is a distinction called bound morphemes verses free morphemes so what are those so bound morphemes are those morphemes that cannot appear as a word by itself ok so for example take the previous example unhappy so i cannot take the morpheme un here use it as a as a unique single word itself so this is bound by another word that is applied with this say unhappy so it is it is bound with happy or some other words with this you can be use it on the other hand if i take the word happy it is [free/free morphemes] it can used on it is soon ok that is how we divide the morphemes into these two categories bound verses free so here are some examples so bound morphemes are like s so it can be used for making plural so with dog we have dogs l y so quick to quickly and e d walk to walked so these are all bound morphemes and then there are free morphemes when they can appear as a word by themselves ok and they can also combine with other morphemes if needed so for example if i take the morphemes like house it can appeared as a word by itself but can also be combine with other morphemes like s to make plural houses similarly walk it can combine with e d to make a plu[ral]- make a past tens of walked and so on some words like of ah in etcetera they are also free morphemes they can appear on their own so then there is another distinction and this is very very important when we talk about morphology so in general when i talk about a word it can have two main parts one is the stem the main the root word and another is the affix and it can have more than one of affixes as well so what are stem and affixes ok so when we talk about a word so ah a stem is the core meaning bearing part ok so i take i take a word like boys so the the the stem here will be boy so that is the meaning can bearing part and then there are various ah bits and pieces that can be apply to it that that can ultra certain grammatical functions so i can have i can apply and as at the end of to make a plural of this so these are called affixes so in general you can make a correspondence between ah stems and affixes and bound and free morphemes so you can say that the stems are kind of free morphemes and the affixes are kind of bound morphemes so this kind of correspondence you can you can make so now what are the different types of affixes that you can apply with the given stem so this we just discuss about one simple example of applying s so this s apply after the word boy are make a plural with boys so this is called suffix that is applied at the end of the word but in general what are the different types of affixes that can be applied so so we start with prefixes so prefixes are applied before the word so some example in english are un so we make unhappy anti antinational pre preexisting and so on we have these prefixes in other languages also for example in hindi and sanskrit we have (Refer Time: 07: 00) the prefixes like ah [FL] that we can apply with various words or verbs so these are of prefixes then we have suffixes that are applied after the word so like with the word talk i can make a new word talking by applying the suffix by i n g similarly the word quick i can make a new word quickly by applying the suffix l l y at the end ok and in in the case of hindi for example you can have this exercise like tha and k a ka etcetera that can apply after the words then so the prefix and suffix are the major major su[sufix]- major suffixes affixes that we have in language but certain language have some other kind of exercise also so one is called infix that is it is applied in between that stem not before or after that so ah so example is like in sanskrith we have the word with to know and we make the present tense by putting vindati so the word the the character n the phonin n is applied in between between v and the so you becom becomes vindati so there are examples in other languages also like in the case of philippines here basa b a s a is read and to make it the to converted to the past tense read the infix u m is applied in between so we have b u m a s a so u m is applied in between is called infix now so can we think of an infix in the case of english english it is not common in in common language it is not infix is not used but in general can we make a word in english that that uses infix so so here an example is if i take the word absolutely and put a word bloody inside so you can have a word like [ab/absolute] bloodilutely so this is to put some emphasis that is not used in common english (Refer Time:09:00) but in ah certain movie dialogues and all you can find such kind of words finally so what can what you think can be the fourth category we have prefix suffix infix what is the meaning is that a suffix an affix comes before as well as after so this is called circumfix ok so this proceeds as well as follows the same word so an example in dutch so you have a word for mountain b e r g and to to converted to plural we have an affix that is applied before g e as well as after so the the whole affix is g e t e half of that is applied before and half of that is applied after so this is called circumfix so among this four kind of affixes the first two are very very common prefix and suffix and the last two are expressive to certain languages only now morphemes can also be divided into some other categories like content verses (Refer Time:10:00) functional morphemes so what are content morphemes that are those that will that will be a semantic meaning ok so for example if even if i take any free morphemes like car a word it is always a content morphemes it contents some semantic meaning similarly i can take a morpheme bound morpheme like able also that is a semantic meaning that given a word it it it keeps a sense of being able to do something so on the other hand there are certain morphemes that are functional that do not take the semantic content they are only used for certain grammatical functions like as for plural as for third singular they are both functional morphemes you apply it after a word and it has a particular grammatical meaning but it may not be a syman[tic]- it may not contain a semantic meaning as such now so based on whatever kind of affixes that you that you apply to a word (Refer Time:11:00) you will generate a new word ok so for example if i if i have a word walk and i apply a suffix i n g i get a new word like walking ok so there is a process that converts a word walk to walking ok so by putting certain morphology here now take another example i take a verb like drive and i i add some affix and make a new word like driver so now what is the differences that you see in the two processes ok so we can call it may be e r drive plus e r that gives you driver so from drive we can creating driver verses from walk you are creating walking so what is the difference that you see in the two processes (Refer Time:12:0) so if you think about it in the first case we not changing the grammatical category of the word as such ok so this is a verb walk it remains the verb here also walking but we add some grammatical information as a continuous text on the continuance other hand here you start with the verb drive and we end up making a noun you covert the category of of the verb itself by this process of morphology so there are two different kind of morphological processes so this is called inflectional morphology and this is called derivational morphology ok so so in this slide we are seeing the difference between between these so so they they they give you the relation between two words that you have you have created first case you have created from walk to walking so what is the relation between these two words second case you created drive to driver what is the relation between these two words (Refer Time:13:00) so in flectional morphology if makes changes in the terms of numbers tens case and gender ok so for example if you start with the word verb bring you can alter the case you can have brought you can have third person singular brings and so on so they do not ah change the ah category of this word so but you add some more grammatical information that is all so this is called inflectional morphology you are adding certain inflectional information only in the grammatical sense that is not change in the category of the word on the other hand you have derivational morphology where you create some new words and you also change the change the category of the word so this is called part of speech that we will take up in the same week in in the in the fourth module so it changes the category of the word so for example from logic you can make logical and illogical logicality logician and all that and there you can you can see (Refer Time:14:00) the do not have the same category all these words they have they are different categories one is noun adverb and and so on adjective in general derivational morphology is also fairly systematic like inflectional morphology but sometimes certain derivations will be missing ok so for example here is here is some nice examples so if i take the word sincere i can make sincerity scarce scarcity curious curiosity but from fierce you should not use like fiercity ok although it is very very if it looks very very regular if you starts seen from the previous words so they are pretty regular but some words do not have the corresponding derivational words now so we are talked about whatever the various kind of morphemes ok and what are the process what are the different types of affixes that you can apply but in general what are the various morphological process that are involved (Refer Time:15:00) to convert one word into another word ok so so we will talk about this so for so one simple process is called concatenation so we will take various morphemes and concatenate together to make a new new morpheme ok so for example happy un you make unhappy simple concatenation similarly here hope and less together make hopeless and un happy make unhappy and anti capital i s t and s these four morphemes if you concatenate together and then make a single word or singular morpheme so now then we are combining the different morphemes together at the boundary or when they are combined there may be certain changes ok the changes can be in in the way the final word is pronounced or in the way the final word is writen so there is two are called fundamic changes and graphemic changes graphemic in the terms how the word is written (Refer Time:16:00) and phenomic in the way word is pronounced so here some examples so if i take a word book and if morpheme book and a morpheme s if i combined together i get books so s see the pronunciation if i take shoe and s i get shoes so here it is not s it is za it is a different phonyms that terms so there are certain changes that happen at the boundary in terms of how the word is pronounced similarly if i take word like happy and e r these change at the graphic graphemiclable so where in the grapheme y changes to i so this is also called simply spelling change at the at the morpheme boundary so this can happen there are some morphological processes also like reduplication so then we adding in a suffix you might do reduplication somewhere in the stem so example is (Refer Time:17:00) like in number language if i take a word go or look if i want to say examine with attention i will say i will just repeat the go go similarly in tagalog you have basa for read and if i want to say will read i will i will read duplicate ba ba ba sa so you reduplicating one part ok in sanskrit again this is very common phenomena or reduplication i take the word like much that is to cook and if i if i want to converted it to the perfect form cooked i will reduplicate the pa and i say papaca so you see the word pa is reduplicated they can be reduplication also ah in in certain languages also ok example in telugu so certain phrase is repeated again so for example i want to say the child fell down while walking so here i say [FL] so here [FL] is being repeated twice for saying while walking ok there are other morphological like suppletion where a word is completely ah replaced by something that has no connection at the ah surface lavel so i have a word like go and i am converting into the past tense and it becomes went so you cannot find any connection go and went and this are surface label this is simple supplition similarly with good i can make better ok and there are many examples in english for this sometimes there some internal changes in the morpheme so from from sing you want convert the plural you will so from sing you can get sang and sung for different ten tenses and from men to converted to plural and you get m e n ok and from goose you get geese for converting to plural so you see there are there are changes there are in internally in in the word you not adding any new suffix then while we are talking about word formation they another process called compounding so that is i can take two different words and make a compound out of that ok and this compounding can be from various part of speech for example in english i can two take two adjectives so bitter and sweet i can make adject single compound bitter sweet i can take two nouns rain and bow i can make a noun rainbow i can take a noun and verb pick and pocket and this becomes a verb pickpocket ok similarly over do what is interesting is that these compounds are very very particular to languages ok so let us take an example like room temperature that is a that is a compound in english but is there a corresponding compound in hindi so you you never say [FL] as a single compound you will say [FL] so that means so finding this compound is in interesting problem for going to application like machine translation so where you you cannot just directly convert the words into the equivalent ah ah target languages so you cannot say room with combined temperature with [FL] you need to find out with there is a compound there is relation between the two words and according to the translation then there is another process that is called acronyms ok for example the word laser is an acronyms then there is blending ok so your take so this is again a very common process linguistic so were you take two words and then you combine together blend them together to make a new word but the you are taking from both the words but you not taking the full words so example is breakfast and lunch you can take together and make a new word like brunch ok similarly smoke and fog you make a new word a smog motor motor and hotel make a word like a motel ok and there is a process of clipping ok so that used a lot for example i have doctor doctor becomes doc laboratory becomes lab and advertising because becomes add dormitory becomes dom and examination becomes exam bicycle becomes bike and refrigerator becomes fridge so this is clipping so long words are shortened so now so this is all the different processes that happens in happen in morphology now so from the n l p prospective so we will talk about how do we process of morphology so what do a what does it and until what processing of morphology so what are different things that that are done so one simple thing is lemmatization that is given a word can identify what is the root word what is the lemma ok an example is is if a give me a word like saw can i tell what is the root word is it a if it is a verb the root word what will be see ah but if it is a noun the root word will be saw itself so you can find a what is the root word silly it is lemma there is there is a morphological analysis also so that is even a word can i find out what is the corresponding lemma along with morphological category of that word ok so it is particular tag so example is i take a verb word like saw can i tell the the lemma is see and this a past tense of that verb or saw is the lemma and it is a noun singular noun so this is morphological analysis of the given word then there is a process called tagging so where i find out what is the actual ah so what is the actual category of this word so the difference here is from the morphology analysis that i also have to disambiguate so morphological analysis you saw i was giving two different possibilities in tagging i have to further find out what is the actual correct grammatical category here so i have a sentence is peter saw her i know the word saw can be either a noun or verb and we also so their lemmas but can i say can i tell in this particular context the word saw will only be a verb and not a noun so can i do the actual disambiguation also this is that is how tagging is different from the morphological analysis and then we have a morphological segmentation where given a word i can segment to with different morpheme that involved so i have a word like denationalization i said de nation a l i z ation they are different morphemes that are in this word so in general among all these processes so part of speech tagging is very very popular so will words sometime for that and before that we will quickly see what is ah morphological analysis lemmatization how it is done ok and finally there is also these process of generalization where i can take a word a root word and a particular grammatical category and i have to generate a a a new word from this so see ah and i want to generate past tense i want to find out saw ok in n l p it is not very popular unless you are talking about national language generation where you might want to use this ok so ya before going into the process what might be the application for doing this why should we be interested in doing morphological analysis for example text to speech synthesis ok so what is text to speech synthesis you have seen something that is written and you have to find produce the corresponding is speech speech for that so now if you have a word like lead written somewhere now depending on whether it is a noun or a verb you will have a different pronunciation for that ok lead verses led depending on noun or a verb so it is important of find out from the text whether it is a noun or verb ok same thing goes with read ok read verses red in general it is very important for other things likes search and information retrieval ok so might want to use the a morphological category to reduce the certain space ok and also machine translation we saw some example and especially because if you know the morphological category you can find out the for the target languages what is corresponding affix is or different words that is being used in that languages and grammatical error correction and and all that so if you if you know what is the morphological category of this word in the whatever is written if you can find out this is not the correct morphology that is use you can try to correct it so now what is morphological analysis so this is have seen earlier so as i input we have words like cats cat citizen so on and as an output i want to find out given a word like cats what is the root verb here cat what is category noun and it is a plural cat plus n plus p l something like that so in this table so if i am a given input in the left as per the left column i want a output like the right column ok so so the output that i will generate will contain additional information like this i0073 noun this is singular for s g for singular p l for plural and v for verb like that so this is all the information that i want to get from the from the given word now what might be the issues involved while doing morphological analysis one particular problem is that it is not very very regular for example from the word boy i can get plural boys but what happens if i taken input like fly i get flies f l i e s ok so this you see that they are following two different sort of tools for doing changes at the bounding similarly if i take the word like toiling i can get toil but what happens if i give an input like duckling should i used same sort of full to get duckl that is not correct of english word ok so how do i know the duckling is not a correct english word when an input like a duckling is provides to my system similarly from getter i get g e t plus e r from doer d o plus e r but what happens if given input like beer do i output like b e plus e r so these are some of the issues that involved in processing morphology now if i have to solve these issues what is what are the different knowledge that i need to have so so i need to have some knowledge on what are the different words or fruits in english ok so for example i need to know that duck is a possible root but duckl is not a possible root in english so we need some sort of dictionary or lexicon of english what are different nouns and verbs etcetera in english what else i need to have some knowledge of morpho techniques what is morpho techniques that is which kind of morphemes follow other kind of morphemes for example if i have to convert a noun to plural i know plural morphems always follow the noun so this is the morphotactics information which morpheme follows are the morphemes then i also need to have this information that some endings go only on certain words not on everything so on d o i can apply e r to get doer but on b e on the verb b e i cannot apply e r to get a word like beer so this is again these constraints also i need to have and then i need to some worry about spell spelling change rules so then whenever i have word like get i apply e r it converts to getter so there is just duplication on of duplication of the ending t so now so one question you might have is that ok why cant i put everything together in a big lexicon so that is all the root words all their morphological variants why cannot they already put in a big lexicon and there i can search even new word i can search in the lexicon find out what is the actual word and its category if they are finite by country do that so there are two different reasons why this may not be very good solution so one is if you take any language like english it is very easy so where for a given but they are not many variations in terms of morphology so ah so this is some strategies from a data set that in english there are roughly you take ninety thousand lexical entries and you will find out all the possible morphological forms that you can generate then you find a ratio of three point five two one that is from word you can generate roughly three point five more very to variants including that word in english but this is not true for other languages for example the same thing if you do for sanskrit you have a lexicon of one seventy thousand entries but if you try to derive the forms so the ratio that you come up with is something like sixty four point seven is to one ok so the eleven million forms that are generate so these are huge in number ok so sixty four is a very big ratio in comparison to three points five but again this may for now it may not be a very big number again ok you can still argue that this might this will it be put in a big lexicon and and you can search over that but there is another problem ok that is you can keep on coining new words and apply the same morphological processes to generate its forms and you do not know these words a prior so you cannot store their morphological variants in the lexicon so on the other hand if you can store the what kind of rules in valued for mailing from a word to its plural given a new plural form you can try to find out its original root word ok so that is why we will be studying what kind of methods are possibly used and the one of the most popular method in this field of computation morphology finally state methods ok so this was very very popular earlier first the language like english also and and later on for other languages like indian languages another european language so even now if you talk about processing the morphology methods are one of the most popular choices so fine so in this lecture we talked about composition morphology what are the linguistics terminologies and and what is the process as such what is the n l p perspective there and in the next lecture we will talk about how do i use final state methods for this processing ok thank you
