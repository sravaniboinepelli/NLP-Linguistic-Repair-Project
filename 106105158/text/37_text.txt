 so hello every one welcome to the week eight of this course in the last week we had started a discussions on semantics and we discussed a particular method for caption semantics that ware distribution semantics so how we can use the distribution patterns of words in a corpus to extract meanings out of that and we said that how we can compare two words to find out if they are more similar than an an another pair of words so so in this week what we will be doing we will be taking another approach of semantics that is by using the connections that we see among items in an lexicon and that's where we will also see how to use a very ah important resource that is word net for extracting meaning some ah between words so so topic for this week is lexical semantics so how can we define lexical semantics so as a as i am saying what we are doing in this topic we will see some entries in a lexicon and we will try to identify what is the relation between these generatives so we will have some particular set of relations and we will try to defined these relation among these entities so so in that way we can define this this field so lexical semantics is concerned with the systematic meaning related connections among lexical items so i will have a certain lexical items in my lexicon and i will try to find out what are the connections between any two items and we will be also see what are the internal meaning related is structure of individual lexical items so what you are seeing here we are not focusing our attention to something called a lexical item so what what is the lexical items so so lexical item i there is another term for that this called lexeme so this is this is nothing but an individual entry in my lexicon so here i am talking about connections among different lexical items and what is the single entity it will call a lexeme and we will mostly we talking about in terms of lexemes now so if we try to understand intuitively what would be there in an entry in in an lexeme entry what what are the things that i need to keep in an entry so because i am also talking about the meaning if a word as multiple meanings it should not be called like a single lexeme it should be called as two different lexemes so when i talk about lexeme what all things i need to have i need to have what is the form so how do i spell that how do i pronounce that and also some something that says what is the meaning of this particular entry so these are the two important components that make like a lexeme so i will have so i can think of lexeme as a pairing of some orthographic and phonological form that is how do you write the lexeme how do you pronounce that and with some sort of symbolic meaning representation ok something that might be definition of the lexeme or something that explains what this it's stands for so when i talk about orthographic form and phonological form they are the the form part of the lexeme and then i have a science part of the lexeme that talks about the meaning of the lexeme so if we have seen in various dictionaries that's all the entries are also defined so let me take one example so this is example from the dictionary that comes with mac so you are having a a suggest single word like verge but it appear size three different lexemes so we are having verge one verge two and verge three ok and do you do i see the pair the form part in the meaning part so form part is giving on top for each entry so i have the spelling so that is the same for all three then i have the pronunciation also ok then there is there are certain descriptions about this entry that that correspond to what is the meaning of this entry for example you might have the lexical creditory of that so it's a noun it's a noun it's a verb and then there is some meaning like an edge or border they they come they come down to the verge of the lake so also given an example how it is used and some history of the words also provide it so when i talk about lexeme that's what i need i need a form part that can be the spelling of the lexeme plus the pronunciation and the meaning part once i have done that now we can try to establish relations between various lexemes in my lexicon or each lexical items in my lexicon so now what are the various meaning related facts you can extract from the with the lexemes and defined in my dictionary so let's take some examples from this heritage american heritage dictionary so is nineteen eighty five version and what we are seeing here we are seeing four different entities here right left red and blood they are four different lexemes in my in this dictionary and some meaning of these entities are also provided so so for example right is defined as located near the right hand especially being on the right when facing the same direction as the observer and left is defined as located near to this side of the body then the right so this is some definitions provided to these lexemes now what is something that you can immediately ah some point that you can immediately see from the these definitions so one thing that you see is that the word right has been defined terms of right this is some sort of circular definitions if you say if you say in that way and also lexemes are defined in in terms of other lexemes ok so like here red the color of blood or a ruby and blood is defined the red liquid ok so blood is defined in terms of red and red is defined in terms of blood so we see that there is some sort of circularity involved here in the in the way we have defined in the lexicon but even even if that is the case you can still extract some sort of meanings for example if you see the definitions of right and left you can easily find out that they are somewhat related they mean their meanings are very much related and you might also say that they might be in some sort of ultra[vation]- with respect to each other ok so so what do we see here so the entries are description of lexemes in terms of other lexemes and from the definitions i can see that right and left are some similar sort of lexemes and they are in some sort of alternation or opposition also from these definitions we can see that red is some sort of color and and it can be apply to blood as well as ruby and blood is some liquid so you might extract some other facts about the lexemes also from these from these entries now in general so when i am talking about identifying what is the connections of different between different entries what are the various formal connections that have been defined and what are the relations that we can study so let us have a look at some of the relations so so these are some very important relations that are established between word meanings and forms so like homonymys polysemy synonymy antonymy hypernymy hyponymy and meronymy and you might have heard of some of the list terms like polysemy which very very popular and similarly synonymy and and antonymy so these we might already have heard so let us try to formally define what are these relations and and when do i say that to and it is my lexicon are connected by a particulation from one of these so how do i define homonymy so homonymy is defined as a relation that holds between words that have the same form but unrelated meanings so what is that mean so we have defined an individual entre entries in my lexicon as having if form part and a meaning part so now if two entities have the same form part but the meaning part is different then they will called the homonymys ok you think of an example of ah two such or a single word that as the that as ah same form but two different meanings so simple example might be like the word bank bank and before the financial institution bank or it can be some river bank similarly bat it can be for the cricket bat or it can be the bat as a mammal so what you are seeing here they are having the same form but different meanings so these are two examples that that we talked about now so there is one important thing that you should remember here so we are seeing that they have the same form but different meanings but we have defined form to be both orthography form and phonological form so it might happen that it in certain cases the orthography form is same and meaning is different and in some cases the phonological form is same and meaning is different they are called homonymys but there are specific terms for both of these and these are called homographs if there is the same orthography and homophones if there is the same phonological form let us see some example so homophones are the words that have the same pronunciation but different spellings ok and different meanings also so example here are write and right there is the same homological form they are written differently and their meanings are different same with piece and peace and homographs would be the lexemes and that the same orthographic form then they would have may be the different pronunciation and different ah meaning all to gather so for example the two different usage of bass one in the sense of in the sense of a guitar or music now now why do we need to worry about this ah homonymys so we will see what are the different n l p application where they create a problem so ah let's take this example of text to speech so do you think these homon homophones or homographs would create a problem for ah text to speech so what do we do in text to speech in text to speech you would have a text contain written it can be a sentence where there are multiple words together and you need to speck that out so why the homophones or homographs can create a problem for that now think of the same ah same word that as the that as the particular spelling but it is pronounce into different ways into different meanings so unless you know what is the particular sense it's being implied you cannot pronounce it properly ok so if the of orthographic form is same but the phonological forms are different that creates a problem for text to speech now it can also create the problem for information retrieval so so why the problem for information retrieval so suppose you are looking for the term bat ok and by bat you implied the the mammal but sup the suppose the systems gives you ah cricket bat as as the ah desired or as the ah page edge that that you will look for and immediately it will not match your information need so what would happen if the same word as multiple meanings if you are searching for that word because your only a specifying the the orthographic form it is not it may not be clear to the search engine what is the meaning that you are looking for so this also create a problem for the search engines and it might be problem for the speech in also for example the perfect ah homonymys ho homophones where you have the same phonological form but different way of writing that so suppose you are writing to ah suppose you are speaking to so it may not be clear which of the three words should be ah the correct interpretation whether it is to or to or two t w o t w o ok so these are also problematic for i speech reorganization so these are some problems where they they create problem ah now so suppose the the systems have to deal with that so how do they find out when i am talking about to is it t o or is it t w o t t double o and for that they have to use various information from the context in which that is spoken or something about the speaking and so on and some of the problems of this kind we will also deal in this week in the topic of word sense disambiguation that if a word as multiple meanings how do i use the context to identify what is the particular meaning is beings used here so now coming to the second relation that is polysemy so polysemy and homonymy might be confused with a certain times so polysemy is also the same sort of relation that is a word as multiple meanings but the same form but the difference here is these meanings are very related and not unrelated tight we had in the case of homonymys so in case of homonymys two words have same form but very different meanings for polysemy they have the same form and slightly related meanings ok not not very very similar and not very very different also so what is the example let us see ah let us focus on the word bank here in the two sentences in the first sentence we see the bank was constructed in eighteen seventy five out of local red brick and second one is the the sentence i withdrew the money from the bank so as such if you if you look at this sentences you may feel that so there the same word bank is being used in the for the same sense but if you look closely you find there is some slightly def some slight difference between the meanings of the word bank so what is the difference here in the first sentence the bank is used as some sort of building that belongs to a financial institution ok on the other end second sentence it belongs to the financial institution itself and that sort of ah slight gradation in meaning is is there in many many such words for example let us look at these two sentences heavy snow caused the roof of the school to collapse and the school hired more teachers this year than ever before so again the same word school is being used an as they look the same sense but again if you look closely this refers to the building of a school and this refer to the institution a school as such or their administration so and and these relations are called systematic ok so for example if you look at these words school university hospital church supermarket all of these can be seen as the building as such or the institution and that's why the two meanings would be ah slightly related they are not very very different and not exactly the same there are some other examples like you can have the men the ah connection between the author and the works of author so if i say jane austen wrote emma some talking about the author on the other hand i if i say i really love jane austen so what do your meaning is that i really love the works of the author so author in works of author again appearing some sort of slightly different meaning side that is that is ah observed by ah this term polysemy similarly animal versus meat so when you chicken it can be animal or meat similarly sometimes it can be tree versus fruit and this kind of relation like if i say plums so if i in this sentence plums have beautiful blossoms plums mainly refer to the tree but here i ate a preserved plum would be a fruit so again there are very very slight distinction between the meanings here now ah ah in in linguistics so suppose i want to distinguish ah identify if the if the same word is being is into different sentences it is been used in slightly different ah meanings ok all is it is the word polysemys somehow so what is one particular linguistic test that we can do and this test is called zeugma test and what is the idea suppose the same word has been used in two different sentences now try to compose a single sentence where the word has been used only once and the two different ah usages have been captured by some sort of consumption and see if this sentence is making sense already is looking weird if the sentence is making sense ok so probably this word as the same sense in both the sentences but if the sentences looks weird then you ok there are polysemys so here is an example so i have the same words serve being used in two different sentences so which of these flights serve breakfast and does midwest express serve philadelphia now i want to find out if there is some polysemy involved in the usage of the word self here so what i would do i would combine these to ah usages together in a single sentence so what can be one sentence we can compose out of this so you can compose like does midwest express serve breakfast in philadilphia ok and immediately we are serving breakfast in philadelphia putting them together in the same sentence looks weird ok you can put them in to a different sentences ok but putting them in same sentence looks weird then we can say that so these two usage of the words are are polysemys so here does midwest mist west express serve breakfast and san jose if you put them together it ah sounds weird so we say that they are two different senses of the word serve so so that's what we have covered homonymy polysemy remember they are very very ah it may not be easy to distribution among the two in polysemy they are quite related in homonymy they are very very different in general if you might also you might in in general you might say that word is you note that the word has multiples senses now the next relation that we will see is synonymy what is synonymy two words that have very very similar meanings but different orthographic and phonological form so examples are like couch and sofa they have same meaning different words big and large automobile car water h two o ok so now what is a important here is these two words are similar meanings but probably they are not substitutable in all the contexts ok for example in scientific context you might want to write h two o but not water but when you are all talking in general terms you would use the term water crossing you to give give you water you will not ask give you h two o ok so so all though the meanings might be very very singular depending on the context you use one word or the other so as such we can call two lexemes are synonyms if they can be successfully substituted for each other in all situations but this not actually the case we cannot in general you cannot substituted them in all the places you can probably do them most to the places but not so now let's take an example so i take two words big and large and let's see these sentences how big is that plane i can also write how large is that plane so would i be flying on a large or small plane so with word plane i can use the word either big or large and both are substitutable here so in that sense they look like perfect synonymys but can i always replace big for large of large for big in all the contexts let's see this example suppose i have the sentence miss nelson for instance became a kind of big sister to benjamin ok and suppose i replace big by large here and the sentence comes out to be miss nelson for instance became a kind of large sister to benjamin and immediately you can see that this this usage of word large immediately it starts looking weird ok and why is that the case so that means we cannot substitute large for big big here ok and and why is is that so because you would you would see that big has a very very specific sense that is being grown up or elder and that sense never applies to the word large ok so big has a sense of being older or grown up but large as such lacks this sense it does not have this sense sometimes they are very shades of meaning in an some sort some words of being preferred to use them other words like when you are talking about what is the cheapest first class fare we will talk about you will prefer to say fare then price ok sometimes there are collocational constraints so with some particular words only one word goes not the other one even if they have very very similar meanings for example before mistake would you ah like big mistake or large mistake generally big mistake is preferred so here this is the sentence so we frustrate e m and frustate e m and pretty soon they make a big mistake ok and we would not substitute large here so large mistake is not collocational but big mistake is collocational ok so because of language usage also some words are preferred to be used then others so they cannot be substituted at all places probably in some places now coming to the next relation that is antonyms so here i say that so what is the general ah notational the general ah definition of antonyms two words if they are entirely opposite to each other they are opposite to each other but this is something interesting about antonyms so two words antonyms if they are completely ah so we we said that they are they are having very very opposite meanings but in general if you look closely they will have very very related meanings but they are opposites only in word particular aspects so let's take one example see like hot and cold ok so so do you call them are they related or are they very very diff very different so as such they are related they both talk about temperature yes but they are at the ah opposite ends of the history extreme so we will say ok it's cold one extreme and hot is the other extreme but as such both talk about temperature and ah suppose you you try to use the distribution semantic method that we tried in the last week to capture if two words are antonyms it might become very very difficult because we would occur in very very similar contexts yes so hot and cold occur with words like weather yes temperature and so on so so what we are saying in antonyms they are having very very ah similar meaning but they are opposite only in one aspect of the meaning so like dark and light short and long ok hot and cold up and down in and out they are opposite only in one aspect otherwise they are similar so more formally we can say that and antonyms can define some sort of binary opposition or at opposite ends of a scale so like long and short hot and cold fast and slow and be reversives it's like rise and fall now coming to another important relation that is hyponymys and hypernymys now what are hyponymys and hypernymys so they are relations between a subclass and a super class ok so so formally we say one sense is a hyponym of another if the [fir/first] first senses more specific and a denotes a subclass of the other so example here is like car car is a subclass of vehicle so we can say that car is a hyponym of vehicle similarly dog is a class of animal so we say dog is a hyponymy of animal and mango is a hyponymy of fruit because mango is a type of fruit now just the other other way round the relation would be called hyponymy so i say mango is a type of fruit so fruit is a so so fruit is a super class so mango is a hyponymy of fruit and fruit is a hyponymy of mango ok so conversely we can define the hypernymy relation also so vehicle is a hypernym of car and animal is a hypernymy of dog and fruit is a hypernymy of mango and these are of some of the relations that we will ah see very very closely what is so how do we use hypernymy relation for extracting various meaning related facts among entities so with hyponymys we can also defined some formal ah criteria so for example entailment if i say that sense is a hyponymy of sense b that means being an a entails being a and b for example as a dog is a hyponymy of animal dog is subclass animal is super class so being a dog entails being an animal as it's some some entities dog it is an animal so it will have all the characteristics of animal also impose on that and but you cannot say the other way round that is some ah if someone something is a dog animal it is also called dog this is not valid so if a is a hyponymy of b i will say being an ah a entails being an b you can also define the transitivity relation that is if a is hyponymy of b b is a hyponymy of c then a is also hyponymy of c that is also very very trivial condition on hyponymys so entailment in transitivity now we can also define other relations like meronymys and holonyms so meronymy is some sort of asymmetric but transitive relation between senses what is that so i will say x is a meronym of y if x denotes a part of y so it's not symmetric so example is so here porch is a part of house or wheel is a part of car so to define the part of relation i say wheel is a meronym of car leg is a meronym of chair nose is a meronym of face and the other where round relation is called holonym that is face is a holonym of nose car is a holonym of wheel and so on so now so so we saw what is the different relations that we can defined among lexical entities so now ah what are what are the different lexical sources where these relations are nicely captured so where you can you can find out what entries are related by the relation of hyponymy hypernymy and meronymy and use for different ah tasks or application that you want to bit and that's what we will see in the next lecture then we will ah have a discussions on what is the structure of word net and how are all these relations defined in word net and how can you can use that to capture various semantics like ah whether these two words are related or not and to word degree that will be the ah topic for the next lecture thank you
