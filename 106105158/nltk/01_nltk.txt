so hello everyone and welcome to this course on natural language processing so in this course we will we will be having this course for twelve weeks and in which week will have five modules so today we are starting this course and this is the first module ah first lecture for this week and this is basically the course introduction what what are the different topics we will be covering this course what are the different text books that you might be using for this and some other details that might be necessarily for you ok so firstly my contact so if you have certain questions you can only you may also write to me on this email i d so this is my official email id and you might also want to visit my web page that is provided in in this link so in this course we will have two teaching assistants so amrith krishna and mayank singh both are my phd students and they are working on n l p so so idea is that they can they will be able to help you with any of the queries that you having during this course and they will also help you with all the assignments that we will providing this course so they will so in addition to me they will also be your primary contacts during this course so in this course we will be following two of the main so very very popular books on natural language processing so so jurafsky and martin is a very popular book so title is speech natural language processing so so this is your second addition but there may be also be the third addition that is available so you might you second additional and any later additional for of this book for this course then there is a book by manning and schutze on foundations of a statistical natural language processing by m i t press that is again a very very popular book and we will be using concepts from both the books along which some other sources in this course so you can you can try to avail any of these two books or both the books if possible and with with the course some addition reading from this book will be helpful for ah addition the the concepts and getting a good class on the course so in addition to the books you you will also get the lecture slides so from the lectures that i will be taking this course all those slides will be made available to you and if necessary i will also point out to some additional ah a person and any other material that might be helpful for you so that also will provide on the on the course website and we also thinking of giving you some ipython note books so so that you can also do some sort of hands on so these note books are so you will be using python for doing certain text twicing tasks and so this will we will also provide you some basic instructions on how to start teaching this ipython note books so they will also very very helpful for this course because this is n l p is mostly and hands on so its its not very very nice just to have an l b course to have only the theory theoretical knowledge its important also so that given a problem you can a start doing some processing over that ok so in in for the evaluation so we will have assignments that will be given after every week throughout the course so that will constitute twenty five percent of the of the whole evaluation of for this course ok so they will assignments will be on the lectures that are that are covered in this course also we might also give you some sort of programming assignments time to time in this course so they will be all been in python plus so there will with the final exam that will be constituting seventy five percent of the overall weightage that mean the after the end of this course so what are the different topics that we will be covering this course so this course we have we have starting with so the basic topics that are required for understanding all the concepts in in n l p then we will move to some applications so what are the various basic topics that we will be covering this course so we will start with the text processing so given a text data how do you start doing some processing over that so that may include how do i tokenize it that is breaking in to various words how do you i start doing lemmatization stemming find out the route words and so on then we will be start with very foundational topic on language modelling that is how do i use the ordering information inside the language for developing certain applications so how can i use this statistics then we will go to the morphology that is what to different categories of words and given a text data how do i start finding out different categories of words so what are the different applications or algorithms that i can i can use then we will go to the to high level finding out what are different groups in the sentence how they are connected to each other in the topic of syntax then we will move to se semantics where we will have various models of semantics using lexicon and lexical semantics and using the distributions and distribution semantics and we will also touch upon the topic on word embeddings that is very very popular ah as of now so finally we will also cover topic mortis so how do you find out what are the various topics that i have covered in a given text data and how do you i make use of this in various applications then after cub once the basic topics are covered we will also devote some time especially in the last three weeks on how do you a start applying these basic concepts for certain applications so n l p is very very broad topic and you will see enumerable applications where you can apply all these concepts but to give you an idea so we will take three very very interesting and important application in n l p so will start with the topic of entity linking and information extraction this will be the first application that will be cover then we will go to text summarization and classification finally we will end up with opinion analysis and opinion mining so this will be the the final application that we will be cover and we will hope that whatever basics and some aspects of application that we cover in this course will help you in taking any new problem and starting to think of euron approach for solving that ok so idea of this course is that you you are not only aware of what are the tools available you can use them on your own but also you are you know what are the basic algorithms what are the foundations and given a new problem you can think of a think of a approach on your own and build your own tools so that is the the goal of this course and as i said earlier this is million introductory course but all the basics that that are required for dealing with any advanced topic will be covered so if you take any new research topic that is not covered in this course the idea would be whatever knowledge is covered will help you to at least start understanding the topic and then go deep in to that so now so if you works on why do we need to study n l p ok so so what does so what is n l p so n l p is all about processing text data so now you see in in on on everywhere so you can find out this abandons of text data ok now you can also see the text is the largest human knowledge a pastry that you that you have so so what are the various sources where you find all these knowledge in in text data so you can think of all the wikipedia articles for instance all the news articles that come dealing ok so all the scientific articles they are available and text format patents all with the all the social media all they have tweets facebook posts and everything is also available in the text format so now this abundance of text data and this is all quite un structured ok so to be able to make use of this information and build some rise applications you should know how to process this data and thats why n l p comes in to picture so ya so with recently with all the tweets facebook posts comments over all the news articles everywhere and quora so you have an abundance of text data and you should you should be aware of some tools by which you can do certain analysis of this data so now so so this is one thing that we have a lot of text data available this is another another problem that so so much data is available that is unstructured but this is not in the single language for example in its not in english so so this gives you some this chart gives you some a statistics so so what you will see here so this is from november twenty two thousand fifteen how many millions of users are there in on internet and different languages you see yes english users are the highest at the same time you have lots and lots of chinese users and then spanish and arabic and again you see large number for all the rest language that are not covered in this chart so you will not be able to understand all the languages so and you will needed tool that can take any given language and try to put it in the language that you can understand ok so some sort of tools are are necessary so that they can automatically find out what is the language provided in this document how do i ah translate to some languages that i know and so on doing some information summarization over there and translation ok so you need n l p in all of these aspects so now so this lecture i will just end with dealing saying what is n l p ok so what is the main goal of n l p as such what for this research field of n l p so if you think about it so so there is a very very broad ah scientific goal of this field of n l p and that is can be understand language can we have a very very deep understanding on how human process language can we teach computers how to understand language so that is i will say a deep scientific goal behind all the n l p so can we teach computers on understanding language and they can may be respond with humans the way humans to and and so on so that is very very longest and in goal of n l p so this we would says mainly a fundamental scientific goal ok i want to have a deep understanding of broad natural language but with that we also be very very practical and engineering goal and what is that so the goal is that so yes there is lot of text it available even if i do not know how to make computers understand that fully can i still make use of this data to build some very very nice applications that that will be helpful for people in they really life and that you can see from you own life so how many different applications that you might be using ok starting from the search that is very very very ah common application that every one uses and so you will see in in a lot of other applications starting from news recommendations and and all that that your using a new really life ok so so this is the engineering goal for n l p that is can i design implement and test systems that will process natural language and that i design for very very practical applications that we can use in day to day life so this is the engineering goal of n l p and that is what we will be mainly focusing in this course and n l p ok so all the concepts and and algorithms that we will discuss in this course are mainly focus to words various engineering applications of n l p so so with that i again welcome you for to this course so so in the next module or the next lecture we will discuss what what do we actually do in n l p by taking some simple examples ok thank you
